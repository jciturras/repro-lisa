abstract = {We investigate trends and cross-national variation in the impact of class, religious, and gender cleavages on voting behavior in six advanced capitalist democracies in the postwar period. Earlier research on cleavage voting has been criticized for utilizing outdated "two-class" models of class structure, simplistic left/right party distinctions, flawed statistical approaches, and incompatible and/ or limited of cross-national empirical evidence. We take such criticisms seriously and seek to overcome them. Using multinomial logistic regression models, we analyze data from a new dataset, the International Social Cleavages and Politics (ISCP) file, which contains comparable, over-time cross-national data from 112 nationally representative election surveys of voters in six Western democracies in the period 1964-1998. The six countries examined in the paper (Australia, Austria, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States) are unique because of the existence of time series data available for all three cleavages. Our analyses examine the changing magnitude of the class, religion, and gender cleavages for up to five distinct party families for each country. Unskilled workers have become less distinctive in their partisan alignments over time, but other classes have experienced offsetting changes, yielding little evidence of a universal decline in the class cleavage. Further analyses suggest an important degree of stability in the aggregated effects of all social cleavages, while also revealing significant cross-national differences and trends in the magnitude of specific cleavages. These results refine debates concerning the possible decline of social cleavages; implications for research are discussed in conclusion. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an International Socio-Economic Index of occupational status (ISEI), derived from the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), using comparably coded data on education, occupation, and income for 73,901 full-time employed men from 16 countries. We use an optimal scaling procedure, assigning scores to each of 271 distinct occupation categories in such a way as to maximize the role of occupation as an intervening variable between education and income (in contrast to taking prestige as the criterion for weighting education and income, as in the Duncan scale). We compare the resulting scale to two existing internationally standardized measures of occupational status, Treiman's international prestige scale (SIOPS) and Goldthorpe's class categories (EGP), and also with several locally developed SEI scales. The performance of the new ISEI scale compares favorably with these alternatives, both for the data sets used to construct the scale and for five additional data sets. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {This study reviews international comparative studies investigating people's views on inequality. These studies are classified using a framework consisting of three types of conceptions on inequality and two dimensions of inequality. Four perspectives are discussed explaining cross-national differences in views on inequality: the modernist, the culturalist, the micro and the macro perspective. The findings of studies comparing views on inequalities in post-communist and western states provide more support for the modernist than for the culturalist perspective. Few comparative studies appear to investigate views on inequalities as independent variables impacting on other social attitudes and behaviours. It is argued that the social relevance of the field will be enhanced if more studies can show that views on inequality have an effect on social outcomes complementary to that of objective inequalities.},

abstract = {People who believe that their society has few impediments to upward mobility tend to oppose governmental redistribution. This is true even among the poor. Is this because people with this belief expect to be well off in the future, and hence oppose redistribution on self-interested gounds?  Or is it because they believe that the less well off have not made the effort to move up, and therefore are morally undeserving of support? This paper uses quantitative sensitivity analysis to examine the robustness of the evidence for each of these views. It finds that the effect of prospective mobility is sensitive to measurement error in current income. In contrast, there is robust support for the view that beliefs about moral worthiness matter.},

abstract = {In a general equilibrium model of a labor economy, the size of government, measured by the share of income redistributed, is de- termined by majority rule. Voters rationally anticipate the disincen- tive effects of taxation on the labor-leisure choices of their fellow citizens and take the effect into account when voting. The share of earned income redistributed depends on the voting rule and on the distribution of productivity in the economy. Under majority rule, the equilibrium tax share balances the budget and pays for the voters' choices. The principal reasons for increased size of government implied by the model are extensions of the franchise that change the position of the decisive voter in the income distribution and changes in relative productivity. An increase in mean income relative to the income of the decisive voter increases the size of government.},

Analyzing multi-source data for a large sample of UK physical and engineering scientists and employing a matching technique, this study suggests women academics to engage less and in different ways than their male colleagues of similar status in collaboration activities with industry. We then argue – and empirical assess – these differences can be mitigated by the social context in which women scientists operate, including the presence of women in the local work setting and their wider discipline, and the institutional support for women's careers in their organization. We explore the implications of these findings for policies to support women's scientific and technical careers and engagement with industry.},

Although many stud- ies have examined the properties of GFI as indicators of overall model fit for sin- gle-group data, there have been none to date that examine howGFIs change when be- tween-group constraints are added to a measurement model. The lack of a consensus about what constitutes significant GFI differences places limits on measurement invariance testing. We examine 20 GFIs based on the minimum fit function. A simulation under the two-group situation was used to examine changes in the GFIs (∆GFIs) when invariance constraints were added. Based on the results, we recommend using ∆comparative fit index,∆Gammahat, and∆McDonald's Noncentrality Index to eval- uate measurement invariance. These three ∆GFIs are independent of both model complexity and sample size, and are not correlated with the overall fit measures.We propose critical values of these ∆GFIs that indicate measurement invariance.},

In most tele-phone surveys, however, little information is available with which to estimate these effects. We report a procedure for examining the potential effects of nonresponse via analyses that (1) investigate the linkages between community-level (zip code) variables and survey nonresponse and (2) examine the associations between these community-level variables and key survey measures. We demon-strate these procedures using hierarchical modeling to analyze data from a state-wide telephone survey in Illinois. One zip code–level indicator of concentrated disadvantage—the percentage of the popu-lation below poverty level—was found to be positively associated with nonresponse and, among respondents, with both current physi-cal disability status and lack of health insurance coverage, suggest-ing that both may have been underestimated in this survey. This inexpensive approach has the potential of enabling researchers to routinely evaluate nonresponse effects in their survey data.},

People may prefer more redistribution to the poor if they believe that poverty is caused by circumstances beyond individual control. Therefore, beliefs about the causes of income may affect demand for redistribution. Alternatively, the effect of these beliefs on redistributive preferences may be spurious if they are correlated with income, and self-interest is not properly controlled for.

abstract = {Economic insecurity describes the risk of economic loss faced by workers and households as they encounter the unpredictable events of social life. Our review suggests a four-part framework for studying the distribution and trends in these economic risks. First, a focus on households rather than workers captures the microlevel risk pooling that can smooth income flows and stabilize economic well-being. Second, insecurity is related to income volatility and the risk of downward mobility into poverty. Third, adverse events such as unem- ployment, family dissolution, or poor health commonly trigger income losses. Fourth, the effects of adverse events are mitigated by insurance relationships provided by government programs, employer benefits, and the informal support of families. Empirical research in these areas reveals high levels of economic insecurity among low-income households and suggests an increase in economic insecurity with the growth in economic inequality in the United States.},

abstract = {Moore (1966) once argued that the American Civil War was a fundamentally "bourgeois" revolution. As such, Moore's account falls in line with much of the larger literature on democratization, which emphasizes the class dimensions of democratic expansions and transitions, but is largely silent on how party politics are implicated in those processes. Such approaches miss a great deal of the party, inter-elite and discursive dynamics that are crucial to understanding the origins and consequences of democratic change. This chapter seeks to discern the impact of mass party formation and political discourse on modern routes to democracy through an examination of mid-19th-century Chicago politics. It holds to Moore's conclusion that the American Civil War was indeed a bourgeois revolution, while demonstrating that the trajectory of party politics before, during and after the war challenges Moore's interpretation of how class forces were mobilized in the American case. Partisan shifts, for example, worked at turns to weaken and strengthen the rhetorical and organizational basis of working-class mobilization, suggesting that democratization and the class coalitions that give rise to it are shaped and re-shaped by the context of partisan struggle. {\textcopyright} 2008 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {In this article, we show that large-scale macro-political change can powerfully condition how institutional practices shape individual cultural choice. We study the paired comparison of Portugal and Spain, two long-similar societies that moved from authoritarianism to democracy through divergent pathways in the 1970s. Data from the 2001 Eurobarometer indicate that while the cultural choices of persons born before democratic transition are comparable across the two cases, Portuguese youth born under democracy are substantially more omnivorous than their Spanish counterparts. We shed light on this puzzle through a structured, focused comparison. Our argument is that whereas revolution in Portugal overturned hierarchies in numerous social institutions and unleashed an ambitious program of cultural transformation, Spain's consensus-oriented transition was largely limited to remaking political institutions. We show that this macro-political divergence resulted in a key cross-case difference at the institutional level. Whereas pedagogical practices in Portugal encourage young people to adopt the post-canonical, anti-hierarchical orientation toward aesthetics constitutive of the omnivorous orientation, corresponding practices in Spain restrict omnivorousness by instilling a hierarchical, largely canonical attitude toward cultural works.},

While appropriate for some populations in some periods, this perspective may omit important sources of intergenerational continuity of family-based social inequality. Social institutions, which transcend individual lives, help support multigenerational influence, particularly at the extreme top and bottom of the social hierarchy, but to some extent in the middle as well. Multigenerational influence also works through demographic processes because families influence subsequent generations through differential fertility and survival, migration, and marriage patterns, as well as through direct transmission of socioeconomic rewards, statuses, and positions. Future research should attend more closely to multigenerational effects; to the tandem nature of demographic and socioeconomic reproduction; and to data, measures, and models that transcend coresident nuclear families.},

Based on simple economic principles, the text emphasizes the importance of analyzing the working conditions of those individuals who have re- cently gone through the system of higher education in Chile. The empirical results show that for a significant fraction, particularly those who do complete their degree, having gone through the system of higher education may not translate into better economic conditions. The analysis demonstrates the urgency of presenting more precise and comprehensive evidence of the true role of the system of higher education as driver of social mobility. Does the system of higher education contribute to social mobility? Of course it does, as long as the quality of education is secured and the student has the capacity to take advantage of it},

It first elaborates a theoretical argument that explains the effect of events and points to economic conditions, the size of the immigrant population, and personal contact as mediating factors. This argument is evaluated using the fact that the terror attack in Bali on October 12, 2002, occurred during the fieldwork period of the European Social Survey. The findings from this natural experiment reveal considerable cross-national and regional variation in the effect of the event and its temporal duration. The analysis on the regional level supports the argument about contextual variations in the response to the event and a second analysis based on the 2004 Madrid bombing confirms the study's conclusions. Implications of the findings for societal responses to terror attacks, the literature on attitudes toward immigrants, and survey research are discussed.

The analyses show that there is cross-national variation in the performance of mathematics and that it is related to variation in the gender stratification of educational and occupational opportunities in adulthood, that sex differences have declined over time, and that school and family factors leading to higher mathematical performance are less stratified by gender when women have more equal access to jobs and higher education.},

It is hypothesised that those who experience improvements in socio-economic status through social mobility are more likely to blame poverty on individual characteristics such as laziness and lack of willpower and are less likely to attribute failure to injustice in society, and on the macro-level, the effect of social mobility on perceptions of popular explanations of poverty is moderated by contextual environment. The described hypotheses are tested by using multinomial and multilevel logistic regressions and two complementary datasets—European Values Studies and the Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings suggest that social mobility is indeed associated with perceptions of individual blame and social blame of why some people are in need. However, these effects are manifested primarily among subjectively mobile individuals and are also conditioned by the legacy of socialism and the level of economic development of countries where individuals reside.},

This belief system justifies status inequalities by locating the cause of status differences in the individual talents and efforts of group members. We hypothesized that activating meritocratic beliefs increases the extent to which individuals psychologically justify status inequalities, even when those inequalities are disadvantageous to the self. Specifically, we hypothesized that priming meritocracy prompts individuals to engage in system-justifying psychological responses when they experience threat either at the personal or group level. Across two studies, priming meritocracy led members of a low status group to justify both personal and group disadvantage by decreasing perceptions of discrimination (Studies 1 and 2) and increasing the extent to which they stereotyped themselves and their group in status-justifying ways (Study 2). ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

By analyzing these evolved origins, it is possible to develop novel, testable predictions on the structure of political heuristics. This argument is illustrated through an extensive review of studies on the structure of the so-called deservingness heuristic.

Multilevel logistic regression analyses show that religious regulation in a country diminishes religious attendance and that there are only small negative effects of people's own education and average educational level of the country. Religious attendance is strongly affected by personal and societal insecurities and by parental and national religious socialization and level of urbanization. These theories explain 75{\%} of the cross‐national variation in religious attendance.},

We argue that this distinction is not only conceptually cogent, but empirically important as well. Indeed, class and status do have distinct explanatory power when it comes to studying varying areas of social life. Consistent with Weber assertions, we show that economic security and prospects are stratified more by class than by status, while the opposite is true for outcomes in the domain of cultural consumption. Within politics, class rather than status predicts Conservative versus Labour Party voting in British general elections and also Left-Right political attitudes. But it is status rather than class that predicts Libertarian-Authoritarian attitudes.},

abstract = {This paper considers whether it is still possible to identify a status order in contemporary Britain. We analyse the occupational structure of friendship and present empirical results which show that there is one dimension of this structure that can be plausibly interpreted as reflecting a hierarchy of status. This status hierarchy is gender-neutral, and displays clear continuities with that depicted for the later nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries in historical and earlier sociological research. We examine the connection between status and both income and education and show that the status order we identify is distinct either from income or education or from 'socioeconomic' status as determined by income and education in combination. As regards status and class, we find that, while some classes show a rather high degree of status homogeneity, in other classes status stratification is quite extensive. Our results suggest that the Weberian distinction between status and class remains valid and potentially highly revealing. By retaining this distinction in social stratification research, a range of questions on the articulation of the class structure and the status order and of their effects on life chances and life choices is opened up.},

When comparing groups an assumption is made that the instrument measures the same psychological construct in all groups.

The main reason for this is that contemporary state build- ing takes place in a globalised context which alters the effects of the central processesx which Tilly (and others) argued placed war-making and state-making in a positive relationship. The thrust of the argument is that these mechanisms and processes continue to be useful and essential for understanding the relationship between wars and states. However, if we look at how they work, it soon becomes clear that they fail to create a positive link between wars and states. The point is therefore not to contest Tilly's analysis of European situation. Rather, the chapter shows that if we take Tilly seriously – i.e. follow the arguments he actually devel- ops and grant his argument more than folklore status – it helps us to understand why wars at present do not make states, but rather unravel them.},

abstract = {Sociologists want to do more than describe social inequality. We want to understand the deeper problem of how inequality is made and, therefore, could potentially be unmade. What are the mechanisms? How do we uncover them? To do this more effectively, I argue that we need to more thoroughly incor-porate the effects of a relatively neglected form of social inequality—social status— alongside effects based on resources and power. To make my case, I will attempt to show how status acts as an independent force in the making of inequality based on gender, race, and class. Abstract To understand the mechanisms behind social inequality, this address argues that we need to more thoroughly incorporate the effects of status—inequality based on differences in esteem and respect—alongside those based on resources and power. As a micro motive for behavior, status is as significant as money and power. At a macro level, status stabilizes resource and power inequality by transforming it into cultural status beliefs about group differences regarding who is " better " (esteemed and competent). But cultural status beliefs about which groups are " better " constitute group differences as independent dimensions of inequality that generate material advantages due to group membership itself. Acting through micro-level social relations in workplaces, schools, and elsewhere, status beliefs bias evaluations of competence and suitability for authority, bias associational preferences, and evoke resistance to status challenges from low-status group members. These effects accumulate to direct members of higher status groups toward positions of resources and power while holding back lower status group members. Through these processes, status writes group differences such as gender, race, and class-based life style into organizational structures of resources and power, creating durable inequality. Status is thus a central mechanism behind durable patterns of inequality based on social differences.},

abstract = {In an attempt to make sense of shifts in the social movement sector and its relationship to conventional politics over the past forty years, some have proposed that Western nations are increasingly becoming "movement societies." Accordingly, there are four key characteristics of the movement society: (1) over time expansion of protest; (2) over time diffusion of protest; (3) over time institutionalization of protest; and (4) over time institutionalization of state responses to protest Using newly available data on over 19,000 protest events occur-ring in the US. between 1960 and 1986, we evaluate these four claims. Our findings suggest that movement society scholars are correct in some respects: the size of protest events has grown over time, the percentage of events at which at least one social movement organization is present has increased over time, the number of distinct protest claims has increased over time, and violent forms of protest policing have decreased over time. However, our findings call into question other movement society claims: the number of protests has declined over time, fewer organizations were present at each protest event over time, fewer new groups initiated events over time, fewer new claims emerged over time, and there was more significant activity by groups on the right in the 1960s and 1970s than expected. We suggest potential explanations for some of the negative findings in an attempt to refine the movement society arguments.},

abstract = {Empirical research on cultural and social capital has generally ignored the key role of institutions in setting standards that determine the contingent value of this capital. Furthermore, many studies presume that the yielding of profit from cultural, social, and economic capital is automatic. Bourdieu's concept of field high- lights the ‘‘rules of the game'' and shows that parents' displays of capital only are valuable when they help parents comply with institutional standards. In this article, we examine how the field shapes parents' efforts to transmit advantages to their children through accessing high-status elementary schools. Drawing on interviews with 45 black and white middle-class families, as well as observation of school admission events and interviews with 20 school administrators, we illuminate the rules of the kindergarten admission game and describe how parents attempted to use capital to compete in the field in one large, urban dis- trict.We show the rules to be complex, hard to learn about, and implemented inconsistently. In this con- text, cultural, social, and economic capital that helped parents navigate the field had the potential to be profitable. But even parents with deep reservoirs of capital did not realize their first choice when they misunderstood the rules of the game or faced an imbalance of supply and demand for slots in highly desired schools. Thus, we argue that models need to take into account both the situational meaning of capital and the uncertainty in parents' efforts to use their capital to transmit advantages to their children.},

Adding to this growing literature, we provide evidence that the deservingness heuristic does not treat all social benefits alike.Already at the level of preconscious processing, the heuristic displays a bias toward tagging the recipients of health care—that is, sick individuals—as deserving. This powerful, implicit effect overrides other opinion factors and produces broad-based support among the public for health care—across levels of self-interest, media frames, ideological divides, and national cultures. In contrast, when the deservingness heuristic is utilized for reasoning about unemployment benefits, implicit psychological constraints are fewer and political conflict erupts depending on differences in interest and worldviews. Using a variety of methodologies, we track this fundamental difference between the politics of health care and unemployment benefits from the level of implicit processing to the level of political attitudes.},

Not only are the advantages of each approach combined, but also there is a synergistic value to the nested research design: for example, statistical analyses can guide case selection for in-depth research, provide direction for more focused case studies and comparisons, and be used to provide additional tests of hypotheses generated from small-N research. Small-N analyses can be used to assess the plausibility of observed statistical relationships between variables, to generate theoretical insights from outlier and other cases, and to develop better measurement strategies. This integrated strategy improves the prospects of making valid causal inferences in cross-national and other forms of comparative research by drawing on the distinct strengths of two important approaches.},

abstract = {Why is there political support for progressive taxation and government transfers in western democ- racies? We study the importance of fairness preferences, risk aversion, and self-interest in deter- mining support for redistribution by conducting a laboratory experiment that includes both ele- ments not previously found together and novel features. Our design permits within-subject com- parisons of the effects of earned vs. unearned sources of pre-tax-and-transfer inequality, within- subject comparisons of choice as a disinterested observer of inequalities among others versus that as an affected party, and within-subject comparisons of choice with and without uncertainty as to own pre-tax income. Between subject variation lets us study the effects of changing the direct cost of taxation to the decision-maker and the efficiency cost to the society. We use large subject groups and the actual U.S. pre-tax income distribution to create a more macro framing than in related past experiments. We show how our results can be used to calibrate individual utility func- tions defined over own expected income, own income variance, social inequality, and efficiency, and we examine what the estimates mean for the median preference for redistribution and the level of redistribution that maximizes additive social welfare. Most of our subjects prefer that there be less inequality among others and demand for redistribution responds in predictable ways to the cost of taxation and to the deadweight loss associated with it. We also find that preferred levels of redistribution are highly responsive to whether or not pre-tax incomes are determined according to task performance, for male subjects, but much less so for female subjects, with this difference accounting for much of a displayed gender gap in which females prefer more redistribution.},

Nor is there satisfactory evidence on the mechanisms by which inequality may have an effect. We study the determinants of transitions to a nonmarital first birth as a single parent or as a cohabiting parent compared to transitions to marriage prior to a first birth among unmarried, childless young adults in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort, from 1997 to 2011. We include measures of county-group-level household income inequality and the availability of jobs typically held by high school graduates that pay above-poverty wages (i.e., middle-skilled jobs). We find that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to marriage prior to a first birth for both women and men. The association between levels of inequality and transitions to marriage can be partially accounted for by the availability of middle-skilled jobs. Some models also suggest that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to a first birth while cohabiting.},

abstract = {Somewhat divergent approaches to finding the components ofgroup differences (for example, the difference in average earnings across gender or racial groups) have grown up in the literatures ofeconomics and sociology. Both, however, are variants of the same underlying approach. This article illustrates different approaches and draws attention to the conditions under which two, three, orfour components ofthe income gap between groups can be usefully distinguished. The two central issues are which standard one uses to evaluate endowment differences between groups, and whether the scales used to operationalize underlying concepts have arbitrary zero-points or not. This latter difficulty has often been neglected in empirical applications using variables such as education, region, occupation, industry, and marital status. In such cases, the choice of a comparison group is inherently arbitrary, and nothing other than an arbitrary decomposition of the residual group difference can result. n the literature of economics and sociology dealing with discrimination, parallel but comparable applications of regression techniques have been developed to partition observed differences between groups (for example, differences in income between men and women, or blacks and whites). What follows is an attempt to bring these approaches into a common framework, to describe some additional interpretations of the components, and to note some difficulties often neglected in the empirical literature. 1 To illustrate the argument, several simple models relating hours worked to gender differences in income are estimated. The theoretical concept of interest is discrimination. In its simplest formulation, the discrimination model assumes that for},

abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of constructing justice indexes-measures that would quantify the amount of perceived injustice in a society and thus enable comparison of the amount of injustice across societies and over time. I develop a framework, addressing six issues that arise in formulating a justice index, and present two (families of) justice indexes. The first, called JI1, distinguishes between two qualitatively different kinds of injustice-unjust underreward and unjust overreward; the second, called JI2, combines both underreward and overreward into a single type of injustice. The paper describes properties and relations of the two indexes and begins the task of assessing them by providing theoretical and empirical illustration. In the theoretical illustration, I use probability distributions to investigate, a priori, operation of the justice indexes in diverse societies and groups, which may differ in the kinds of goods and bads their members value and in the distributional patterns of those goods and bads. In the empirical illustration, I present estimates of the two justice indexes in a large 13-country microdata set, which provides information on respondents' assessments about the justice of their own earnings in 1991-1992. An important property of one of the indexes is that it enables decomposition of the total amount of perceived injustice into injustice due to scarcity and injustice due to inequality.},

@article{Manstead2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The British Psychological Society. Drawing on recent research on the psychology of social class, I argue that the material conditions in which people grow up and live have a lasting impact on their personal and social identities and that this influences both the way they think and feel about their social environment and key aspects of their social behaviour. Relative to middle-class counterparts, lower/working-class individuals are less likely to define themselves in terms of their socioeconomic status and are more likely to have interdependent self-concepts; they are also more inclined to explain social events in situational terms, as a result of having a lower sense of personal control. Working-class people score higher on measures of empathy and are more likely to help others in distress. The widely held view that working-class individuals are more prejudiced towards immigrants and ethnic minorities is shown to be a function of economic threat, in that highly educated people also express prejudice towards these groups when the latter are described as highly educated and therefore pose an economic threat. The fact that middle-class norms of independence prevail in universities and prestigious workplaces makes working-class people less likely to apply for positions in such institutions, less likely to be selected and less likely to stay if selected. In other words, social class differences in identity, cognition, feelings, and behaviour make it less likely that working-class individuals can benefit from educational and occupational opportunities to improve their material circumstances. This means that redistributive policies are needed to break the cycle of deprivation that limits opportunities and threatens social cohesion.},

One prominent recent study, Newman, Johnston, and Lown (2015a), argues that, consistent with the conflict theory, exposure to higher levels of local income inequality leads lowerincome people to become more likely to reject—and higherincome people to become more likely to accept—the dominant U.S. ideology of meritocracy. Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the study's own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three distinctly different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis. We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion. Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.},

abstract = {A way to give Petr Mateju credit for the "no strict equality" finding for Czech lands: Two decades ago, scholars predicted that the economic and political transformations underway in the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe would be accompanied by fundamental shifts in societal values and norms. Unlike political reforms, changes in societal norms were believed to take place gradually, as individuals became increasingly socialized by new institutions and conditions. In this article, we analyze change in a core set of societal norms�beliefs in distributive justice�in the Czech Republic over the last two decades, and locate those trends in regional perspective. What we find is that, over time, the negative association between egalitarian and meritocratic norms has increasingly strengthened, suggesting a crystallization of those norms as opposing value sets. In addition, attachments to those norms are increasingly structured by respondents� socio-economic status. In order words, the research confirms that subjective norms in the Czech Republic are increasingly shaped by objective social status in ways common in advanced democracies, and that we can speak not only of a crystallization of the value system, but of a corresponding �re-stratification� of justice beliefs in relation to social position.},

Taking the case of Chile, and applying an experimental simulation methodology, we seek to contribute to the epistemological debate about the representations that individuals elaborate about social space, from a cognitive and interactionist perspective of everyday life. We analyse in particular the scope of the concept of social class as an element of expert description of social reality, but also as a categorization used by ordinary subjects. We argue that although classifications used by ordinary people to describe members of society are not consistent with the most common academic class schemes, they nevertheless share the same logic and ranking system, adding evaluative and normative elements to the cognitive distinction, in the social construction of reality.},

abstract = {This article performs exploratory research using a mixed-methods approach (structural equation modelling and a thematic analysis of interview data) to analyse the ways in which socioeconomic disparities in voting patterns are reproduced through inequalities in education in different national contexts, and the role of self-efficacy in this process. The evidence suggests that in Germany and England students with lower socioeconomic status (SES) have lower levels of general self-efficacy, and that this is reinforced through early experiences of inequalities in the education system, such as within- or between-school selection. Low levels of general self-efficacy are then found to reduce political self-efficacy and voting intentions. In Germany and England, it is these students who enter initial vocational education and training (IVET). The experience of IVET then reinforces the distinctions in civic engagement, probably either through peer socialisation and/or curriculum differences. In Denmark, where SES has a weaker association with track placement, the experience of being placed in IVET plays a stronger role in reducing political self-efficacy and voting intentions. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 British Association for International and Comparative Education.},

Moreover, we hypothesized that prescriptive beliefs about merit should have a stronger influence on reactions to the status quo when hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies are weak (vs. strong). In 4 studies, participants' preference for the merit principle and hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies were assessed; later, the participants evaluated organizational selection practices that support or challenge the status quo. Participants' prescriptive and descriptive beliefs about merit were separate constructs; only the latter predicted other hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies. In addition, as hypothesized, among participants who weakly endorsed hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies, the stronger their preference for the merit principle, the more they opposed selection practices that were perceived to be merit violating but the more they supported practices that were perceived to be merit restoring. In contrast, those who strongly endorsed hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies were always motivated to support the status quo, regardless of their preference for the merit principle.

abstract = {Comparative analysis holds a central place in social science research. There is a well-established view in the social sciences that it should be based on variables (see H{\'{e}}ritier, ch. 4, and Schmitter, ch. 14). Yet much research – especially in political science, but also in some branches of sociology – is case-oriented: that is, it aims at rich descriptions of a few instances of a certain phenomenon. This chapter argues that both approaches are legitimate. Variable-oriented studies mainly aim at establishing generalized relationships between variables, while case-oriented research seeks to understand complex units. Some people would argue that case-based comparisons follow a different logic of research, while others insist that the rules are essentially the same.The chapter starts by introducing the debate on comparative analysis, distinguishing the experimental, statistical and ‘comparative' methods. We then single out two main strategies of research, presenting their origins in the methodological reflections by Durkheim and Weber, and focusing on the assumptions that are linked to the variable-oriented and case-oriented approaches, respectively. Advantages and disadvantages of each will be discussed on the basis of illustrations from social science works on democratization, political violence and political participation, looking at examples of large-N statistical research designs and contrasting them with small-N comparisons, especially in the tradition of historical sociology. The chapter also discusses recent attempts to bridge the gap between the two approaches, in particular with qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and recent reflections on the case-oriented strategy.},

Subjective social position shows people's self-location in a social hierarchy. Most studies on subjective social position have typically involved a few countries and neglected the role of national educational and occupational structures. We hypothesise that these characteristics, together with national-level economic factors, modify the effect of individual-level characteristics on subjective social location. Our expectations are based on extended reference group thesis, the big-fish-little-pond and stigmatisation arguments. The results of multi-level analysis indicated that the extent of educational and income inequalities in society as well as occupational structures influence the importance of individual incomes, education and occupations for estimating social position.},

- locate and analyse he events generatins and carrying these crisis foward.
- El "tomarle la pista sociol{\'{o}}gica" a un event.

Para el caso del 11S, los esfuerzos de consideralo como un evento consite, principalmente, entre otra cosas, a documentos oficiales del Estado. 

Objetivo:
Se busca introducir un ejemplo que que vuelve parte de un proceso hist{\'{o}}rico. Un an{\'{a}}lisis de los agentes sociales y pol{\'{i}}ticos involucrados en una serie de dominios (pol{\'{i}}tico, jur{\'{i}}dico, medios, militares y est{\'{e}}ticos) han asertado en caracterizar e interpretar el 11S.

Enfoque:
El punto m{\'{a}}s radical es el "negocio" del event framing como parte crucial el flujo de eventos.
- Aparece el concepto de "scene" otra vez.
- "legitimate cogniton and action" Que se entienda x cosa y se haya Z, ganar el framing

Bounding and unbpindung.

- Evento versus Entidades-estructuras!
- En bounding: la formaci{\'{o}}n de identidad como un proceso multidimensional donde convergen redes sociales diversad, capital cultural que contribuye a diferentes v{\'{i}}nculos etno-raciales.
- En palabras de Sewell "en la divisi{\'{o}}n del trabajo cient{\'{i}}fica, los eventos han sido relegados a la historia, la cual se ha especializado en contar lo {\'{u}}nico y contingente"
- Desde la sociolog{\'{i}}a, el Evento, ha sido conceptualizado como elc onstructo princpal que media entre la acci{\'{o}}n y la estructura: Un evento puede ser tener una alta capacidad estructurante.

Este art{\'{i}}culo tiene por objetivo el daro cuenta de los mecanismos a trav{\'{e}}s de los cuales los eventos forman, reforman y deforman. 

- Los eventos tienen efectos transofrmadores que so durables y significativos.

1. Proponer "explotar" el concepto de evento bounded (quitarlo del seno de la historia)
2. Desarrollar el concepto de restlessness of events.
3. La relaci{\'{o}}n entre formas inteligibles tomadas por los eventos y su existencia "inquieda".

Dando cuenta de los eventos

La transici{\'{o}}n hist{\'{o}}rica est{\'{a}} llena de transacciones de eventos, lo cual tiene consecuencias para la individuos y grupos en t{\'{e}}rminos de su identidad y oportunidades de vida.

- La violencia no es ingrediente escencial de todas las transformaciones hist{\'{o}}ricas, sino una condici{\'{o}}n
* Puede ser previa al evento, pero no parte del evento en s{\'{i}}. OJO

Qu{\'{e}} es la semiosis pol{\'{i}}tica?
Todas las transiciones hist{\'{o}}ricas tiene 2 caracter{\'{i}}sticas: Performativa, Demostrativa y Representacional.

1. Performativa
* La efectividad de la performatividad del discurso va en su aceptaci{\'{o}}n de los agentes sociales. (individuales y colectivos)
- Distinci{\'{o}}n illocusionaria y percolucioanria de esta comunicaci{\'{o}}n (Habermas) 
- los eventos hist{\'{o}}ricos toman forma en estos espacios, coyunturas de estabilidad e inestabilidad.
2. Demostrativa

Apunta y ditingue la "distancia" entre la entidades y las relaciones ("esto" "eso" "este" "esos") 

*11S: nosotros (gringos), ellos (terroristas): 
- la "guerra" y c{\'{o}}mo este discurso contribuy{\'{o}} a la "construcci{\'{o}}n" del 11s ? 
- La fuerza de lo illocucionario y perlocucionario!
- El decir "esto es guerra" pudo tener {\'{e}}xito en t{\'{e}}mrinos performativos 

- La importancia de la Red de informaci{\'{o}}n en el proceso de consolidaci{\'{o}}n de un 'evento'

"Para resumir hasta ahora, los participantes en transacciones hist{\'{o}}ricas deben ser atendidos u orientados hacia tiempos y espacios de transici{\'{o}}n situados, deben prestar atenci{\'{o}}n a los actos ilocucionarios (p. Ej., Advertencias, exhortaciones, declaraciones y promesas) y absorber el perlocucionario fuerza (p. ej., persuasi{\'{o}}n, movilizaci{\'{o}}n y diferimiento) de los performativos emergentes, y deben ser capaces de referirse y recordar estos actos a trav{\'{e}}s de una (re) lectura de sus representaciones posteriores."

POINT OF REST

el trabajo cultural o el cultural field es donde la perfomatividad, demostratividad y representatividad convergen en el dinamismo del cambio. Donde los eventos parecen tomar "hechos concretos"

POWER
La pol{\'{i}}tical semiosis es fundamental en el proceso de la elaboraci{\'{o}}n de la restlessness of events.

Entender el poder como un medium Parsons y Foucault. El poder no es est{\'{a}}tico y orienta/controla la acci{\'{o}}n. 


FINAL
Entonces, para repetir brevemente: los eventos son inquietos porque los medios y g{\'{e}}neros que constituyen las representaciones esenciales, demostrativos y performativos inevitablemente proliferan.

The restless "handoffs" from one genero a otro, la acci{\'{o}}n constante de las representaciones, demostraciones y performatividades producen varias cosas:

1.Mantienen los eventos vivos
2. destacan la incapacidad de otro g{\'{e}}nero respecto de contenes o mantener eventis, destacan los l{\'{i}}mites de sus capacidades.
3. destacna el trabajo competitivo de los actores socials y pol{\'{i}}ticos, quienes despliegan distinos distintas semi{\'{o}}ticas de poder-
4. Hay mecanismos reiterativos que permiten identificarlos como entidades
5. Se hacen cargo de las paradojas de los eventos - la paradoja de que por ejemplo estas no son las cirstalizaci{\'{o}}n, sino que el resultado de su propia circulaci{\'{o}}n.
6. Preveen del desorden interpretativo que eventualmente puede generar el mundo social y pol{\'{i}}tico, mantienen la apertura a la reorientaci{\'{o}}n y reinterpretaci{\'{o}}n.},

Cross-national inequality datasets that have become available only recently allow for the assessment of the link for various sample compositions and several model specifications. Our results confirm the Meltzer-Richard hypothesis, but suggest that the relation between market inequality and redistribution is even stronger when using perceived inequality measures. The findings emphasize a decisive role of the middle class, though also approving a negative impact of top incomes. The Meltzer-Richard effect is less pronounced in developing economies with less sophisticated political rights, illustrating that it is the political channel through which higher inequality translates into more redistribution.},

*Organized: Germany {\&} Japan: Capitalismo paciente, empleadores coordinados y varias formas de labor-market cooperation.
*Liberal: USA {\&} UK: arreglos de corto plazo, empleaodre fragmentados relaciones industriales adversas.

Premisa General:
Entender la propensi{\'{o}}n fuura de las instituciones que hicieron posible las "variaciones de capitalismo", para ello, necesitamos un mejor sentido desde d{\'{o}}nde vinierone stas instituciones, qu{\'{e}} las sustent{\'{o}}, y cu{\'{a}}les son las formas en que han cambiado en el tiempo. 

El inter{\'{e}}s central son las instituciones calificadoras o "skill formation", debido a que estas constituyen un actor clave en la configuraci{\'{o}}n de la econom{\'{i}}a de un pa{\'{i}}s.

2 {\'{a}}ngulos:
1. Perspetiva comparada
2. Longitudinal- en el tiempo

1) Similitudes y diferencias entre ambos tipos de modelos. As{\'{i}} tambi{\'{e}}n la relaci{\'{o}}n entre la emergencia de los modelos econ{\'{o}}micos y las "instituciones negociadoras" (principalmente los sindicatos)

2) Se van a investigar las pistas del desarrollo sistema vocacional alem{\'{a}}n "formaci{\'{o}}n de habilidades vocacionales" en perspectiva longitudinal. Y c{\'{o}}mo esto ha impactado el presente.

* En el caso alem{\'{a}}n, el sistema de formaci{\'{o}}n de habilidades vocacionales es visto como parte de un gran "pack" institucional entre la econom{\'{i}}a, la educaci{\'{o}}n, el sistema financiero y las organizaciones sindicales y empresariales. Un modelo de alta-calificaci{\'{o}}n, alto-salario, "alto-todo"

a. Funcional-utilitarista: parte de un compleo institucional como "alta calificaci{\'{o}}n equilibrada"
b. Poder-recursos: un ejemplo de la fortaleza de la clase trabajadora
c. Sociologico-cultural: cmo parte de una especie de "alemanidad" y modo de auto-goveranza

Origen:
Gobierno autoritario que buscaba generar apoyo de los artesanos independientes y productores que podr{\'{i}}an, eventualmente, apoyar una clase trabajadora radical.

Luego de la WWII, se crearon instituciones que buscaban bienestar social. Sin embargo, las consecuencias no anticipadad por sus creadores fue una redistribuci{\'{o}}n pol{\'{i}}tica-econ{\'{o}}mica, muy diferente a la originalmente pensada. 

Idea base: Son las instituciones las que crearon uan "coyuntura cr{\'{i}}tica". Su desarrollo y emergencia, como atmbi{\'{e}}n los efectos presentes.

Using data from the 2009 Chilean ISSP national representative survey (N = 1,505), this research compared 3 measures of inequality perception and analyzed the influence of status, political position and evaluation of wage justice on perceptual variables, through correlation and regression methods. Results showed that the perceptual indicators are weakly associated with each other and, therefore, they can be regarded as covering different aspects of inequality perception. Furthermore, socioeconomic status had a direct influence on inequality perception, whereas those that evaluate their salary as fair tend to perceive less inequality. The consequences and projections of the study are addressed in the final discussion.},

Few studies, however, have examined whether people believe they live in a meritocratic society. In this paper, we use the 1987 and 2010 General Social Survey to examine people's perceptions of meritocracy in the U.S. Although most Americans agree that getting ahead depends on meritocratic elements like hard work, their beliefs vary in strength. They disagree even more about the importance of non-meritocratic elements such as family wealth, and race. Furthermore, Americans layer these beliefs on top of each other to create a variety of perspectives on meritocracy. Young, upper class Whites are most likely to see the U.S. as a place where meritocratic elements rule. Older, lower class minorities, in contrast, are most likely to believe that non-meritocratic elements dominate. There are also Americans who believe strongly in both types of elements and those who do not believe strongly in either. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. This article explores the association between intergenerational social mobility and attitudes towards income differences in post-socialist societies. I hypothesise that based on the psychological mechanism of self-serving bias in causal attribution, those who experience upward social mobility are more likely to support greater income differences, and that subjective intergenerational mobility has stronger association with attitudes towards income differences than objective mobility because individuals filter their objective environment in order to derive their subjective perceptions of the world and their own experiences. The described hypotheses are tested with two cross-national data sets – European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings are robust to alternative statistical specifications and indicate that individuals who perceive themselves as subjectively mobile have significantly different attitudes towards income differences in comparison to non-mobile groups, but that this effect does not manifest among objectively mobile individuals.},

To answer this, we use unconditional quantile regression models with person-fixed effects, and panel data from the 1979 to 2010 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). We find that among white women, the most privileged—women with high skills and high wages—experience the highest total penalties, estimated to include effects mediated through lost experience. Although highly skilled, highly paid women have fairly continuous experience, their high returns to experience make even the small amounts of time some of them take out of employment for childrearing costly. By contrast, penalties net of experience, which may represent employer discrimination or effects of motherhood on job performance, are not distinctive for highly skilled women with high wages},

This article shows how diffusion theory helps us to better understand this process by specifing ways in which social movement organizations within the same movement may influence one another through indirect network ties. More specifically, I show that a new tactic of protest, the shantytown, spread rapidly among U.S. campuses between 1985 and 1990. Recent advances in the modeling of diffusion in an event historyframework allow me to testfor the diffsion of this innovative strategy of protest among certain groupings of colleges and universities. Specifically, my results indicate that the tactic spread among colleges and universities with similar size endowments, of roughly the same level of prestige, and of the same institutional type. My analysis also indicates that high prestige, liberal arts colleges with smaller numbers of Afican American students had higher rates of shantytown protest.},

a. M{\'{e}}todo elegido por historiadores sociales para reconstruir el pasado usando fuentes primarias o secundarias.
b. Una suerte de "variable independiente" activa en dar forma al pasado.

1.Una narrativa es m{\'{a}}s que una descripci{\'{o}}n: Es an{\'{a}}logo a una historia con un principio, desarrollo y final, con una trama, con varios personajes, y contexto. 

Aparece otra vez el emplotment. Este implica el proveer de "significado" a una historia, a trav{\'{e}}s de la identificaci{\'{o}}n el tipo de historia.

"Narrative intrepretive history" != conventional positivism

2.1. "Ontological" or subjetive. Combiana mensajes hist{\'{o}}ricos, psicol{\'{o}}gicos y culturales. 
2.2. Mobilizational, los cuales son intersubjetivosm, los cuales son dise{\~{n}}ados por sus autores para testablecer y darle soporte valores colectivos y para impulsar solidaridad.
3. La forma de la narrativa puede contener inteligencia sobre los procesos pol{\'{i}}ticos, tales como las motivaciones de las masas a participar y de los l{\'{i}}deres a movilizar personas. "Class is discursive" 

"lessons from the complex hegemonic overlay that Gramsci brought to our attention"
Socializing movement: ense{\~{n}}an valores pol{\'{i}}ticos a grupos espec{\'{i}}ficos. ¿Intelectuales org{\'{a}}nicos?

4. Tambi{\'{e}}n segmentado, el contenido de una anrrativa socialmente simb{\'{o}}lica es justa como tambi{\'{e}}n sint{\'{e}}tica. 

Para entender c{\'{o}}mo el nacionalismo opera como mecanismo que motiva la acci{\'{o}}n individual. Debemos conocer qu{\'{e}} se entiende por nacionalismo.

abstract = {There has been much research on different forms of inequality and their effects on social cohesion. Few studies, however, have explored the psychological and social mechanisms linking inequality to social cohesion and other macro-social outcomes. How do individuals perceive and experience inequalities, and how do these perceptions relate to civic participation, tolerance, trust and other outcomes relevant for social cohesion? The Perceptions of Inequalities project – of which this literature review paper forms an essential part - focuses on inequalities as perceived and understood by young people. In the first section of the paper, we clarify the main concepts and terms used in the study of perceptions of inequalities project, and examine the different types of theories explaining differences in perceptions, values, and judgements relating to inequality, as well as how individuals respond to these. The second section of the paper takes a cognitive and social psychological approach to understand how people perceive inequalities. The third section of the paper reviews international comparative studies in order to assess the influence of societal level conditions on the cognitive elements of inequality (viz. perceptions, values, and judgements of inequality). We take a comparative perspective, and examine perceptions of inequalities within a comparative and ‘macro' context. In the fourth section, we examine the studies that investigate the social effects of the cognitive elements of inequality. In the fifth and final section, we identify the omissions in the literature, and explain how the Perceptions of Inequalities project seeks to address these omissions.},

abstract = {The pace of black insurgency between 1955 and 1970 is analyzed as a function of an ongoing process of tactical interaction between movement forces and southern segregationists. Given a political system vulnerable to challenge and strong internal organization the main challenge confronting insurgents is a preeminently tactical one. Lacking institutionalized power, challengers must devise protest techniques that offset their powerlessness. This is referred to as a process of tactical innovation. Such innovations, however, only temporarily afford challengers increased bargaining leverage. In chess-like fashion, movement opponents can be expected, through effective tactical adaptation, to neutralize the new tactic, thereby reinstituting the power disparity between themselves and the challenger. This perspective is applied to the development of the black movement over the period, 1955-1970. Evidence derived from content-coding all relevant story synopses contained in The New York Times Index for these years is presented showing a strong correspondence between the introduction of new protest techniques and peaks in movement activity. Conversely, lulls in black insurgency reflect the successful efforts of movement opponents to devise effective tactical counters to these innovations.},

The application of multilevel methods allowed to estimate the share of variance in international late careers that can be attributed to country‐specific factors and to quantify the relative impact of specific institutional backgrounds. The share of variance in labor participation and labor market exit among males aged 50+ that can be attributed to institutional characteristics is about 6 to 7{\%}. About 67{\%} of the regional variance in labor participation and 29{\%} of the regional variance in labor exit in Europe can be attributed to measured country‐specific factors, including institutional differences in pension systems and welfare arrangements, employment relation systems, education systems, and employment‐sustaining active labor‐market policies. Controlling additionally for individual heterogeneity provides an explanation for increases in regional variation to 87{\%} for participation and to 48{\%} for the transition to inactivity. Moreover, financial incentives to keep older males in the labor market are outweighed by the monetary incentives of the pension systems, and this applies to both employment maintenance and employment exit.},

The recent tenure of left governments in South America has seen the party system realigned along the class cleavage in Venezuela but not in Brazil or Chile. This article argues that different approaches to expanding social protection— “mobilizational” in Venezuela and “technocratic” in Brazil and Chile—explain divergent outcomes. Mobilizational policies incentivized social organization among beneficiaries and allowed for linkages between these organizations and left parties, facilitating credit claiming and recruitment by the left. Tech- nocratic policies targeted atomized beneficiaries with no room for partisan involvement, making credit claiming and recruitment difficult. Case-based evidence illustrates these mechanisms whereas survey analysis using genetic matching confirms that mobilizational and technocratic programs exerted strikingly different effects on support for left parties. The broader contribu- tion is to theorize a new form of class-based political mobilization in Latin America, also being implemented in other countries."},

The subject of this article is the EGP and ESeC class schemes and their validity for Czech society. The basic question is to what extent these two schemes identify differences in occupational conditions in Czech society. In the first part of the article, the author presents EGP and ESeC schemes, focuses on their theoretical grounds, and looks at the criteria that define social classes within these frameworks. In the second part of the article, the author tests whether these two class schemes really measure what they are supposed to – the criterion validity of EGP and ESeC is tested. After that, the author examines how much the two class schemes predict other social variables on the basis of theoretical expectations – the construct validity of EGP and ESeC is tested. Finally the author compares these two class schemes and discusses which of them is a more appropriate explanatory instrument of occupational inequalities, and the consequent differences in life outcomes in current Czech society. Social classes indicate the inequalities given by the labour market. The magnitude of these inequalities is directly proportional to the instruments by which we measure them. The more subtle the approach we select, the finer the web of inequality we can identify. Keeping this problem in mind, scholars of social class present so-called schemes of class structure grounded in theoretical arguments. These schemes are then tested in specific countries to show to what extent the schemes " work " . They study to what extent the class schemes differentiate among labour positions – to what extent they reflect differences in a given type of labour, type of employment contract, social security and benefits, income, qualifications, and power and prestige. (Goldthorpe – Llewellyn – Payne 1980) Sociological class schemes therefore are not and cannot be the result of empirically identified groups on the labour market, the members of which have access to similar resources and must face the same barriers. Present class schemes are grounded in theory, conceptually clear, and well-constructed. They are designed to explain the differences between occupations in modern societies in the final third of the 20 th century. (Katrň{\'{a}}k 2005) Such class schemes can then be used to study empirical reality.},

In Exp 1, 4,131 undergraduate students completed the PMP, the Proportionality Scale (K. A. Rasinski, 1987), and the Belief in a Just World Scale (Z. Rubin and L. A. Peplau, 1975). In Exp 2, 85 of the Ss participating in Exp 1 (aged 19-25 yrs) completed questionnaires 1 mo subsequently concerning hypothetical situations either upholding or violating merit principles. Results show that the PMP demonstrated superior construct validity as compared with the Proportionality Scale. The PMP was more independent of conceptually distinct constructs, such as prejudice and right-wing authoritarianism. Unlike the Proportionality and Just World Scales, the PMP Scale was able to predict Ss' future attitudes toward affirmative action. The PMP is included.

abstract = {Despite rapid changes in women's educational attainment and continuous labor force experience, convergence in the gender gap in wages slowed in the 1990s and stalled in the 2000s. Using CPS data from 1979 to 2009, we show that convergence in the gender gap in hourly pay over these three decades was attenuated by the increasing prevalence of "overwork" (defined as working 50 or more hours per week) and the rising hourly wage returns to overwork. Because a greater proportion of men engage in overwork, these changes raised men's wages relative to women's and exacerbated the gender wage gap by an estimated 10 percent of the total wage gap. This overwork effect was sufficiently large to offset the wage-equalizing effects of the narrowing gender gap in educational attainment and other forms of human capital. The overwork effect on trends in the gender gap in wages was most pronounced in professional and managerial occupations, where long work hours are especially common and the norm of overwork is deeply embedded in organizational practices and occupational cultures. These results illustrate how new ways of organizing work can perpetuate old forms of gender inequality.},

abstract = {Do schools reduce or perpetuate inequality by race and family income? Most studies conclude that schools play only a small role in explaining socioeconomic and racial disparities in educational outcomes, but they usually draw this conclusion based solely on test scores. We reconsider this finding using longitudinal data on test scores and four-year college attendance among high school students in Massachusetts and Texas. We show that unexplained differences between high schools are larger for college attendance than for test scores. These differences are arguably caused by differences between the schools themselves. Further-more, while these apparent differences in high school effectiveness increase income disparities in college attendance, they reduce racial disparities. Social scientists concerned with schools' role in transmitting inequality across generations should reconsider the assumption that schools either increase or reduce all disparities and should direct attention to explaining why high schools' effects on specific outcomes and groups of students appear to vary so much.},

We use single-equation error correction models to estimate the long- and short-run effects of politics, policy, and economic factors on pretax top income shares between 1949 and 2008. We find that the rise of the super-rich is the result of rightward-shifts in Congress, the decline of labor unions, lower tax rates on high incomes, increased trade openness, and asset bubbles in stock and real estate markets.},

abstract = {Meritocratic attitudes are defined as general beliefs that education and its correlates should determine personal economic outcomes. Using the International Social Survey Project (ISSP): Social Inequality Module (1992), we examine both individual-level and country-level determinants of pro-meritocratic attitudes. According to self-interest and rational-action theories, individuals with high educational attainment and high personal income are expected to have strong meritocratic beliefs because meritocracy is in their best interest---they would gain under such a system. At the same time, both modernization and post-industrial theories imply that persons living in countries with a high degree of societal meritocracy hold stronger meritocratic beliefs than persons living in countries with low degree of societal meritocracy. Results of the Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis on a data set including 7,972 persons from 14 countries indicate that the impact of individuals' education and income on meritocratic attitudes occurred as theoretically predicted. We also demonstrate that the relationship between the degree of societal meritocracy and the degree of support for such a system is statistically significant even if national wealth and educational stock (as well as individual-level variables) are controlled. In addition, we discovered that at the beginning of the 1990s a post-communist regime had a negative effect on support for meritocracy.$\backslash$n},

This article analyzes the impact of local inequality on citizens' belief in a core facet of the American ethos—meritocracy. We advance conditional effects hypotheses that collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality context will be moderated by individual income. Utilizing national survey data, we demonstrate that residing in more unequal counties heightens rejection of meritocracy among low-income residents and bolsters adherence among high-income residents. In relatively equal counties, we find no significant differences between high- and low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality for American democracy.},

The American family has undergone important changes since the mid-twentieth century. Divorce, nonmarital childbearing, and cohabitation increased dramatically. The rise in divorce and cohabitation made the family a less stable unit of socialization and led to a proliferation of step and blended family arrangements with complex configurations of residential and biological ties. As a result of these changes, less than half of children spend their entire childhood in an intact, two-biological parent household, and families are no longer defined solely by shared residence or biology. The instability and complexity of family life requires stratification scholars to rethink how they measure origin and destination class and to consider how parents in nontraditional families transmit class-specific resources to the next generation.},

Call voters with fair preferences, as in Fehr and Schmidt (1999), fair-voters. By contrast, traditional political economy models are based on selfish-voters who derive utility solely from "own" payoff. In a general equilibrium model with endogenous labor supply, a mixture of fair and selfish voters choose optimal policy through majority voting. First, we show that majority voting produces a unique winner in pairwise contests over feasible policies (the Condorcet winner). Second, we show that a preference for greater fairness leads to greater redistribution. An increase in the number of fair voters can also lead to greater redistribution. Third, we show that in economies where the majority are selfish-voters, the decisive policy could be chosen by fair-voters, and vice versa. Fourth, while choosing labor supply, even fair voters behave exactly like selfish voters. We show how this apparently inconsistent behavior in different domains (voting and labor supply) can be rationalized within the model. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This article demonstrates how class origin shapes earnings in higher professional and managerial employment. Taking advantage of newly released data in Britain's Labour Force Survey, we examine the relative openness of different high-status occupations and the earnings of the upwardly mobile within them. In terms of access, we find a distinction between traditional professions, such as law, medicine, and finance, which are dominated by the children of higher managers and professionals, and more technical occupations, such as engineering and IT, that recruit more widely. Moreover, even when people who are from working-class backgrounds are successful in entering high-status occupations, they earn 17 percent less, on average, than individuals from privileged backgrounds. This class-origin pay gap translates to up to {\pounds}7,350 ({\$}11,000) lower annual earnings. This difference is partly explained by the upwardly mobile being employed in smaller firms and working outside London, but it remains substantial even net of a variety of important predictors of earnings. These findings underline the value of investigating differences in mobility rates between individual occupations as well as illustrating how, beyond entry, the mobile population often faces an earnings “class ceiling” within high-status occupations.},

abstract = {Countries with greater inequality typically exhibit less support for redistribution and greater acceptance of inequality (e.g., U.S. versus Western Europe). If individual nations evolve along this pattern, a vicious cycle could form with reduced social concern amplifying primal increases in inequality. Exploring movements around these long-term levels, however, this study finds mixed evidence regarding the vicious cycle hypothesis. Larger compensation differentials are accepted as inequality grows. Weighing against this, growth in inequality is met with greater support for government-led redistribution. Inequality shocks can be reinforced in the labor market but do not result in weaker political preferences for redistribution. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We examine the extent to which Americans and Chinese perceive their countries as meritocracies. Chinese and Americans share a strong belief in the importance of education, ambition, and hard work for getting ahead. The Chinese, however, also believe strongly in nonmeritocratic elements, especially social ties. They are thus much more likely than Americans to have a dual-consciousness about getting ahead. Perceptions also vary within each country. In the United States, minorities perceive less meritocracy than whites and men perceive less meritocracy than women. These factors, however, do not explain variations in Chinese perceptions, which are more closely tied to China-specific predictors (e.g.,hukoustatus). We also find that Chinese perceptions reflect the degree of contact with nonrelatives and people in occupations more prestigious than one's own. Together, these findings suggest that American beliefs about the role of merit in social mobility are not unique. They also highlight a need for studies of stratification beliefs in nondemocratic, non-Western countries and research that examines how life experiences influence stratification beliefs.

Our research tests several rival theories of protest activity for citizens across an exceptionally wide range of polities. With data from the 1999–2002 wave of the World Values Survey, we demonstrate that the macro-level context – levels of economic and political development – significantly influences the amount of popular protest. Furthermore, a multi-level model examines how national context interacts with the micro-level predictors of protest activity. The findings indicate that contemporary protest is expanding not because of increasing dissatisfaction with government, but because economic and political development provide the resources for those who have political demands.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Previous statistical studies of the effects of UN peacekeeping have generally suggested that UN interventions have a positive effect on building a sustainable peace after civil war. Recent methodological developments have questioned this result because the cases in which the United Nations intervened were quite different from those in which they did not. Therefore the estimated causal effect may be due to the assumptions of the model that the researchers chose rather than to peacekeeping itself. The root of the problem is that UN missions are not randomly assigned. We argue that standard approaches for dealing with this problem (Heckman regression and instrumental variables) are invalid and impracticable in the context of UN peacekeeping and would lead to estimates of the effects of UN operations that are largely a result of the assumptions of the statistical model rather than the data. We correct for the effects of nonrandom assignment with matching techniques on a sample of UN interventions in post-Cold-War conflicts and find that UN interventions are indeed effective in the sample of post-civil-conflict interventions, but that UN interventions while civil wars are still ongoing have no causal effect.},

In addition, we provide 10 specific best-practice recommendations regarding persistent and important challenges that researchers face before and after data collection to improve the accuracy of substantive conclusions involving cross-level interaction effects. Our recommendations provide guidance on how to define the cross-level interaction effect, compute statistical power and make research design decisions, test hypotheses with various types of moderator variables (e.g., continuous, categorical), rescale (i.e., center) predictors, graph the cross-level interaction effect, interpret interactions given the symmetrical nature of such effects, test multiple cross-level interaction hypotheses, test cross-level interactions involving more than two levels of nesting, compute effect-size estimates and interpret the practical importance of a cross-level interaction effect, and report results regarding the multilevel model building process.},

abstract = {This study, which is based on a longer report by Willms and Somers (2000), employs hierarchical linear regression models to examine the relationships between 3 schooling outcomes (language and mathematics achievement, and time to complete primary schooling) and family background, as well as various school policies and practices. The analyses employ data from the Primer Estudio International Comparativo (PEIC; UNESCO, 1998), which includes data for 13 Latin American countries, with samples of approximately 100 schools in each country, and 40 grades 3 and 4 pupils sampled in each school. The study finds that the relationship between schooling outcomes and family background varies among countries. The most successful country, Cuba, has uniformly effective schools, and relatively small inequities along social class lines and between the sexes. Across all countries, the most effective schools tend to be those with: high levels of school resources; classrooms which are not multigrade, and where students are not grouped by ability; classrooms where children are tested frequently; classrooms and schools with a high level of parental involvement; and classrooms that have a positive classroom climate, especially with respect to classroom discipline. The article concludes with a discussion about how we might improve capability to monitor school performance in low-income countries.

I found the PMI to be an internally consistent and temporally stable measure of meritocratic perceptions. The PMI positively correlated with other system-justification variables (e.g., just world beliefs and Protestant ethic), negatively correlated with support for social policies that ameliorate disadvantage (e.g., employment and pay equity), and positively correlated with policies that exacerbate disadvantage (welfare reform and cuts to affordable housing). Among participants who completed a tax allocation task, those who scored high on the PMI allotted more dollars to tax rebates and fewer dollars to social programs than did low scorers.},

Are people s beliefs influenced by existing welfare practices in the country? Do different policy regimes trigger different pattern of belief among the members of society?

Individuals with negative status inconsistency (lower perceived status among one's neighbors or friends relative to society) exhibit diminished mental well-being relative to those without. Relational or interpersonal mechanisms, including lower closeness to others, anomie or social disengagement, and diminished meaning in life, appear to partially or mostly explain how status inconsistencies undermine well-being. However, these relational mechanisms vary in their explanatory importance across types of inconsistencies and types of well-being. Positive and neg...},

While material self-interest is the base of most approaches to redistribution (first affecting preferences and then politics and policy), there is a paucity of research on inequality aversion. I propose that other-regarding concerns influence redistribution preferences and that (1) they matter most to those in less material need and (2) they are conditional on the identity of the poor. Altruism is most relevant to the rich, and it is most influential when the recipients of benefits are similar to those financing them. Using data from the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2012, I will show that group homogeneity magnifies (or limits) the importance of altruismfor the rich. In making these distinctions between the poor and the rich, the arguments in this article challenge some influential approaches to inequality, immigration, and voting.},

abstract = {Using case pattern analysis, this study examines Catholic male workforce trends in the majority Catholic countries of Chile, Ireland, and Poland. Employing denominational data for three categories of church male professionals in the 1950–2010 time period, I document four important trends. First, ordinations to the diocesan priesthood in Ireland went into decline especially after Vatican II, have been relatively stable in Chile with only a moderate increase in the 1990s, and spiked in Poland in the 1980s, 20 years after Vatican II. Second, in all three countries the average defection rate among diocesan seminarians increased in the 2000s compared with the earlier two decades. Third, the religious priest workforce has declined in Chile, has been relatively stable in Ireland until the 2000s, and is growing in Poland. Fourth, from the late 1960s there has been a decline in the workforce of religious brothers in each country, especially in Ireland. The theoretical contribution to the Catholic workforce literature is discussed in terms of a critical events argument emphasizing the impact of Vatican II, prophetic stances, sexual scandals, and papal visits on labor market trends. I conclude with implications for the study of religion and society in general.},
annote = {Tres casos elegidos en funci{\'{o}}n de su religiosidad:
- habr{\'{i}}a un link entre la sociedad y la religi{\'{o}}n misma. 

- Tendencias a la baja de la cantidad de matrimonios y bautizos. (1970-2008)

Cuatro variables explicativas sobre el compartamiento religioso y la legitimidad en la iglesia cat{\'{o}}lica:
- Concilio Vaticano Segundo
- "Posturas prof{\'{e}}ticas"
- Escandalos sexuales
- Visitas papales

1. Concilio vaticano
Cambios al interior de la iglesia a nivel del comportamiento frente a temas contempor{\'{a}}neos-
H1.a: El CV2 fue negativo en la "fuerza de trabajo Cat{\'{o}}lica"
H1.b: El CV2 fue positivo en la "fuerza de trabajo Cat{\'{o}}lica"
2. "Posturas prof{\'{e}}ticas"
Discusi{\'{o}}n sobre "temas p{\'{u}}blicos". Relaci{\'{o}}n entre la iglesia y el estado.
Importante: ""Prof{\'{e}}tico" es el nombre dado al compromiso de confrontar diversas formas de pecado en la sociedad y, por lo tanto, a mejorar el orden moral" 
Coherencia del deber moral cat{\'{o}}lico.
H2.a: La fuerza de trabajo cat{\'{o}}lica es afectada positivamente como resultado de la postura prof{\'{e}}tica.
H2.b:La fuerza de trbaajo cat{\'{o}}lica disminuye producto de la postura prof{\'{e}}tica.

3. Esc{\'{a}}ndalos sexuales
Abuso a menores u otros esc{\'{a}}ndalos sexuales.
H3: la fuerza de trabajo cat{\'{o}}lica disminuye como resultado de los esc{\'{a}}ndalos sexuales.

4. Visita papal
- Su efecto puede variar seg{\'{u}}n el nivel de legitimidad de la iglesia y su importancia cultural. As{\'{i}} tambi{\'{e}}n, influir{\'{i}}a carcater{\'{i}}sticas personales del papa. Se esperar{\'{i}}a que el tiempo del efecto fuese obserbable en poco tiempo (1 a 3 a{\~{n}}os)
H4: La fuerza de trabajo Cat{\'{o}}lica aumenta luego de una visita papal.

Conceptualmente, los eventos relatados no deben ser comprendidos como independientes entre s{\'{i}}. Sino, que debe observase desde el punto de vista de "efectos de interacci{\'{o}}n" sobre la fuerza de trabajo cat{\'{o}}lica. (Pto. Anal{\'{i}}tico, mecanismo)

Argumentos alternativos
1. Oportunidad secular
- Oportunidades laborales y educacionales en el mundo secular. Lo cual tendr{\'{i}}a un efecto mucho m{\'{a}}s marcado en las mujeres, que en los hombres. Esto se debe a que tradicionalmente son las mujeres quienes son excluidas del mundo profesional, y es a trav{\'{e}}s de su memebres{\'{i}}a a la iglesia, ordens o congregaciones, donde han encontrado mejores oprtunidades. 
2. Movimientos sociales

Interpretaci{\'{o}}n de que las "ordenes" operar{\'{i}}an en c{\'{o}}digos similares a los de los movientos sociales. No as{\'{i}} la di{\'{o}}cesis.
3. Celibato
La dificultad o aversi{\'{o}}n al celibato es importante para determinar lo propuesto.

Fuentes de Datos
1. Annuario Pontificio
2. Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae
Se quedan con el ASE

Tres categor{\'{i}}as de male workforce:
- Diocesan priests
- Religious priests
- Religious brothers

Adem{\'{a}}s, se usaron datos de ISSP para medir la frecuencia de asistencia a servicios religiosos.

Resultados

H1: Habr{\'{i}}a disminuido el n{\'{u}}mero promedio de {\'{o}}rdenes religiosas luego de concilio Vaticano II.

"Por lo tanto, en los tres casos, las ordenaciones fueron m{\'{a}}s bajas en los diez a{\~{n}}os posteriores al Vaticano II que en los diez a{\~{n}}os anteriores y el orden jer{\'{a}}rquico del declive fue Irlanda, Polonia y luego Chile."

H2: La Actitud prof{\'{e}}tica tendr{\'{i}}a un impacto positivo en la fuerza de trabajo masculina de la iglesia cat{\'{o}}lica. Uno de los principales argumentos, es su v{\'{i}}nculo con demandas relacionadas a la justicia social 

** Se sugiere una interacci{\'{o}}n entre la Prophetic stance y la visita papal, para el caso de Polonia, pero no de Chile.**
- Interesante contextualmente

Para el caso de Chile se explica que las posturas prof{\'{e}}ticas tuviesen un efecto negativo y significativo sobre las renuncias de sacerdtotes, debido a la tibia/conservadora postura de la iglesia.

Se se{\~{n}}ala que en Irlanda, ocurri{\'{o}} que el rechazo a la violencia y la visita papala, interactuaron. Sin embargo, esta hip{\'{o}}tesis no se testea estad{\'{i}}sticamente.

H3: La visita del papa aumenta la Catholic Workforce. No se cumple la hip{\'{o}}tesis, en ung{\'{u}}n pa{\'{i}}s/periodo/orden, la visita del papa afecta significativamente.

H4: Los esc{\'{a}}ndalos sexuales afectan negativamente el tama{\~{n}}o de la catholic workforce. Es significativo para Irlanda, pero no para chile.
- En general relacionado con relaciones con mujeres. 
H4.a: la prosperidad econ{\'{o}}mica.
- El argumento es que un mejor contexto econ{\'{o}}mico, abre la posibilidad de que los hombres obtengan mejores empleos, fuera del marco ecleis{\'{a}}stico.
- Al controlar por estas variables, los esc{\'{a}}ndalos sexuales siguen siendo significativos.

Conclusiones
Muy importante, aqu{\'{i}} se hace referencia a que los estudios de "n peque{\~{n}}o" permiten abordar posibles mecanismos causales involucrados en el an{\'{a}}lisis del fen{\'{o}}meno de inter{\'{e}}s.

abstract = {Meltzer and Richard (1981) state that democracy will boost redistribution of income from the rich to the poor. Given that the median voter is poorer than the average-income voter, a majority of voters will vote for redistribution. However, the positive relationship between democracy and equalization of income has been highly criticized on both theoretical and empirical grounds. From a rational point of view, why do not the poor vote for a higher level of redistribution? Some scholars have argued that expectations of social mobility may induce the poor to believe they will have a higher income in the future and thus to vote against redistribution. However, the sociological literature has shown that people are not well aware of their relative position on the income ladder, because they evaluate their relative income through comparison to others. In this paper, I analyze to what extent preferences for redistribution at the individual level depend on expectations of future income and meritocracy. Departing from previous studies, I analyze whether expectations of social mobility are related to true probability of mobility or whether they are based on subjective expectations of mobility, which depend on perceived position on the income ladder. Empirical results show that preferences for redistribution depend on both expectations of social mobility and meritocracy, although subjective expectations of social mobility have a stronger impact on preferences for redistribution than objective expectations.},
annote = {* If individuals think theu live in a relatively open society where wealth is distributed accordingly to fair distributive principles (mostly meritocratic ones), they may not favor redistribution, since the original distirbution seems to be fair enough.

* For the firste one, expectations of individual upward mobility may discourage people from demanding redistribution, since present benefits may become futuro cost in case they reach high income position.

* Assuming a shared meritocratic idology, indiiduals will compare social outcomes with a tottally open society, in wich only individual merit and effort determine income.

*According to Pikkety's model, income is the result of both effort and inherited factors.

* Both Piket's and Benboud and Tirole0s approaches explicitily take into account beliefs about meritocracy and social mobility.

Medidas :

* Probabilidad de experimentar movilidad social basadao en patrices de probabilidad real.
- Se asume que hay informaci{\'{o}}n completa respecto de la movilidad.

Objetiva: se calcula en base a la probabilidad de experimentar movilidad dada su posici{\'{o}}n en la distribuci{\'{o}}n de ingresos. (deciles)

Subjetiva: Se calcula en base a la posici{\'{o}}n subjetiva en la escala en deciles de ingreso, as{\'{i}} se estima la probabilidad de que en el periodo siguiente se est{\'{e}}s sobre la media de ingresos.

Resultados:

* The subjective probability of being above the mean of income (7th and 8th deciles) also has a significant and negative effect. 
- Para el caso de meritocracia esperar{\'{i}}amos que tuviese un efecto postivo.
* Objevtive probability dos not have a significant impact on the dependent variable. 
- Fisrt, supports the idea that wealth is important to explain preferences for redistribution, given that income and subjective probability of having income above the average in the fiuture will affect preferences. 
- Second, it shows that the subjective evaluation (conditional on the perceived social position) is more important than objective one.

Meritocracia:
* Aquellos que think que la gente se hace rica (o no) a trav{\'{e}}s de su esfuerzo son propensos a aceptar desigualdades y a oponerse a la redistribuci{\'{o}}n. 

{\#}----------

* ambas medidas de las expectativas de movilidad social tienen impacto sobre las preferencias redistributivas, no obstantes el coeficiente para las expectativas subjetivas es mayor.

* Cuando se controla por meritocracia, la expectativa objetiva pierde significancia. 

* People may accept inequalities to some degree if they think these inequalities are the product of different levels of effort. (merit)

* According to these findigns, it can be said that is not where you are (or where you shoul be in the future), but where you think you are (or where you think you will be), what mostly determines attitudes towards redstribution.},

abstract = {Drawing on recent insights in the nationalism and citizenship regime literatures, this article develops a macrotheoretical framework for understanding cross-national variations in tolerance of ethnic minorities. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that the degree to which the dominant ethnic tradition or culture is institutionalized in the laws and policies of a nation-state affects citizen tolerance of ethnic minorities. Employing a multilevel regression model, it systematically tests the framework, as well as competing individual and country-level explanations, for all member states of the European Union in 1997. Results confirm a strong relationship between the laws governing the acquisition and expression of citizenship, that is, citizenship regime type, and individual tolerance judgments. Moreover, citizenship regime type has a strong mediating effect on three individual-level variables previously shown to predict tolerance: ingroup national identity, political ideology, and satisfaction with democracy.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the relationship between education, meritocracy and redistribution. It first questions the meritocratic ideal highlighting how it relates to normative expectations that do not hold fully neither in their logic nor in practice. It then complements the literature on persistent inequalities by focusing on the opportunities for change created by current trends in the economy and in social aspirations. As the meritocratic argument that education is strongly linked to certain rewards in the labour market comes under pressure, increasing social dissatisfaction with education and skills wastage could be expected, as already noted in part of the political economy literature. This literature, however, has tended to conclude from such observations that educational expansion cannot deliver equality. The paper contributes to the debate by focusing on the opportunities created by current trends for the reorganisation of the relationship between education, the economy and society.},

@article{Osberg2006,
abstract = {Are American attitudes toward economic inequality different from those in other countries? One tradition in sociology suggests American “exceptionalism,” while another argues for convergence across nations in social norms, such as attitudes toward inequality. This article uses International Social Survey Program (ISSP) microdata to compare attitudes in different countries toward what individuals in specific occupations “do earn” and what they “should earn,” and to distinguish value preferences for more egalitarian outcomes from other confounding attitudes and perceptions. The authors suggest a method for summarizing individual preferences for the leveling of earnings and use kernel density estimates to describe and compare the distribution of individual preferences over time and cross-nationally. They find that subjective estimates of inequality in pay diverge substantially from actual data, and that although Americans do not, on the average, have different preferences for aggregate (in)equality, there is evidence for: 1. Less awareness concerning the extent of inequality at the top of the income distribution in America 2. More polarization in attitudes among Americans 3. Similar preferences for “leveling down” at the top of the earnings distribution in the United States, but also 4. Less concern for reducing differentials at the bottom of the distribution},

Empirical evidence is drawn from national survey data collected from urban China. Statistical analyses show that multiple indicators of economic well-being exert a significant effect on self-perceived social status and status change and on subjective well-being. Positive status perceptions further enhance one's subjective well-being. Some of these effects are also moderated by contextual inequality. This study advances the literature by moving beyond income-based measures to examine the consequences of economic disparity. It also shows that status perceptions are the key nexus to probe the impacts of economic well-being and the sources of life satisfaction. Findings further direct our attention to important interplays between the individual-level socioeconomic conditions and the contextual inequality in achieving a deeper understanding of the consequences of socioeconomic inequality. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.},

Four explanations of national differences in association involvement are identified and tested: economic development, religious composition, type of polity, and years of continuous democracy. The analyses consider total and working asso- ciation memberships, both including and excluding unions and religious associa- tions. Americans volunteer at rates above the average for all nations on each mea- sure, but they are often matched and surpassed by those of several other countries, notably the Netherlands, Canada, and a number of Nordic nations, including Ice- land, Sweden, and Norway. Hierarchical linear models show that voluntarism tends to be particularly high in nations that have: (1) multidenominational Christian or predominantly Protestant religious compositions, (2) prolonged and continuous experience with democratic institutions, (3) social democratic or liberal democratic political systems, and (4) high levels of economic development. With some excep- tions for working memberships, these factors, both separately and in combination, are clearly important predictors of cross-national variation in voluntary association membership.},

abstract = {This article argues that public opinion regarding the legitimacy of income differences is influenced by actual income inequality. When income differences are (perceived to be) high, the public thinks of larger income inequality as legitimate. The phenomenon is explained by the system justification motivation and other psychological processes that advantage existing social arrangements. Three experiments show that personal experiences of inequality as well as information regarding national-level income inequality can affect which income differences are thought of as legitimate. A fourth experiment shows that the system justification motivation is a cause of this effect. These results can provide an empirical basis for future studies to assume that the public reacts to inequality with adapted expectations, not increased demands for redistribution.},
annote = {{\#}Experimento 

- La informaci{\'{o}}n del nivel de desigualdad a nivel nacional afecta cu{\'{a}}les son las diferencias de ingreso que son consideradas como leg{\'{i}}timas.

Argumento:
La desigualdad de ingresos afecta las percepciones sobre las diferencias de ingresos legitimas. 

* Es contraintuitivo el hecho de que mientras m{\'{a}}s desigual se percibe el contexto, se encuentra m{\'{a}}s justificaci{\'{o}}n y pensar que es "justa" dicha deisigualdad.

*Existe una especie de "proceso de adaptaci{\'{o}}n" a la desigualdad, a trav{\'{e}}s de estas "espectativas adaptadas"

Lo interesante de esto, es que esta baja oposici{\'{o}}n a la desigualdad, discute con las teor{\'{i}}as del inter{\'{e}}s propio que postulan que este ser{\'{i}}a uno de los principales mecanismos que explican la redistribuci{\'{o}}n.

Entonces ¿por qu{\'{e}} a mayor desiguladad, no aumenta la demanda por redistribuci{\'{o}}n?
**Argumento: Esto ocurre xq la opin{\'{o}}n p{\'{u}}blica se ajusta a los niveles de desigualdad existentes. 

Esta "hip{\'{o}}tesis del ajuste" sugiere que cuando la desigualdad de ingresos aumenta, las personas ajustan sus percepciones respecto a lo que constituyen como diferencias leg{\'{i}}timas. 

Entonces;

a. Por un lado, es comunmente observado que mayores niveles de desigualdad no llevan a altos niveles de demandas por redistribuci{\'{o}}n. 
b. Por otro lado, el supuesto de que la desigualdad deber{\'{i}}a llevar a demandar m{\'{a}}s redistribuci{\'{o}}n se mantiene como una idea, incluyendo la evidencia en contra de este supuesto.

**La Hi de "ajuste" es una alternativa a la de auto-inter{\'{e}}s.

**El mecanismo se{\~{n}}alado, es un "obstaculo" en el proceso de demanda por redistribuci{\'{o}}n. A mayor desigualdad, las personas tienden a justificarla m{\'{a}}s.

Entonces, las percepciones de la desigualdad ser{\'{i}}an el predictor m{\'{a}}s fuerte de la legitimiada de las diferencias de ingresos.

Individuos que creen que su sociedad es desigual, tambi{\'{e}}n justifican mayor desigualdad.

Hi: Individuos a quienes se se les asigna aleatoriamente una experiencia de alta desigualdad por cosecuencia, van a pensar que una alta desigualdad es apropiada.

As working long hours becomes increasingly common, a normative conception of gender that prioritizes men's careers over women's careers in dual-earner households may pressure women to quit their jobs. I apply multilevel models to longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to show that having a husband who works long hours significantly increases a woman's likelihood of quitting, whereas having a wife who works long hours does not appear to increase a man's likelihood of quitting. This gendered pattern is more prominent among workers in professional and managerial occupations, where the norm of overwork and the culture of intensive parenting are strong. Furthermore, the effect is stronger among workers who have children. Findings suggest that overwork can reintroduce the separate spheres arrangement, consisting of breadwinning men and homemaking women, to many formerly dual-earner households.},

Although income distribution in Germany, France and Switzerland is very similar, opinions differ widely as to how critically income differences are viewed. This is hardly surprising given that when countries are compared there is almost no connection between the actual distribution of incomes and subjective evaluations of income differentials. In fact, many nationalities assume that the structure of their society is considerably less equitable than it really is. Thus, a factor which far better explains views on distribution is the subjective perception of inequality within a society. Similarly, redistributive preferences are influenced less by actual distribution than by perceived inequality.},

abstract = {A growing number of studies in several countries over the past twenty years have documented the persistence in incomes across generations, and much of the current literature is seeking to understand the processes driving intergenerational mobility and how these differ across time periods and across countries. Education is commonly seen, just as in sociological studies of social mobility or status attainment, as the key driving force of intergenerational associations. In this paper we study the role of education for intergenerational income associations in three countries over time, and across the life-span of sons. We pay particular attention to issues of life-cycle bias and measurement error in modelling income mobility in a comparative setting. To explore the role of education, we utilise a three-stage framework that decomposes the intergenerational elasticity into three parts: the relationship between income and education, the returns to education, and the direct relationship between parental income and their child{\^{a}}€™s income in the next generation after controlling for education. We find that the US and the UK have high levels of income persistence (low mobility) across generations while Sweden is more moderate. Levels of educational inequality are surprisingly similar in all three countries with the majority of the difference between the US/UK and Sweden working through unequal returns to education and, more strikingly, inequality of opportunities for people with similar educational qualifications.},

We argue that his proposition must be tailored to social and historical contexts and that research must specify the underlying social mechanism at work. A consideration of historical trends leads to a more detailed specification of religions in analyses of contemporary cases, and more importantly, to an inductive elaboration of Durkheim's theoretical underpinnings. Analysis of religion's effects on United States county group suicide rates in 1970 reveals that religion continues to affect suicide rates, with Catholicism and Evangelical Protestantism tending to lower rates, and Institutional Protestantism tending to increase them. The presence of Jewish adherents produces a small but inconsistent protective effect. We attempt to account for these results first by examining a variety of standard religious typologies and second by examining evidence on whether religious affiliation reflects the operation of network ties. Finding this evidence suggestive, we move toward a network reinterpretation to clarify and elaborate Durkheim's theory.},

A steady-state majority could even be simultaneously poorer than average in terms of current income, and richer than average in terms of expected future incomes. A first empirical assessment sug- gests, on the other hand, that in recent U. S. data the POUM effect is probably dominated by the demand for social insurance.},

abstract = {This article employs multilevel modeling to assess the importance of income inequality on the demand for redistribution in a sample of 22 European countries. According to standard political economy models of redistribution – notably the Meltzer-Richard model – inequality and demand for redistribution should be positively linked. However, existing empirical research has disputed this claim. The main advantages of this article is that demand for redistribution is measured at the individual level, and that the relevant interaction between inequality and own income is considered. The main findings are that inequality is positively associated with demand for redistribution, and that the median income person is sensitive to the level of inequality. These findings are robust to the inclusion of a range of relevant control variables. The results are relevant in relation to the increase in inequalities in many European countries, and especially relevant to the current debate about the importance of directly observable differences in public preferences for social policy outcomes.},

abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between perceptions of immigration and preferences for redistribution, using survey data from the European Social Survey. Some recent literature argues that hostility toward immigrants will reduce the preferred level of redistribution, primarily because people care about who they redistribute towards (the anti-solidarity hypothesis). Less attention has been paid to the possibility that immigration might be perceived as increasing the risk of income loss, something that should increase the preferred level of redistribution (the compensation hypothesis). This paper finds some evidence in favour of both hypotheses. Furthermore, the paper argues that anti-solidarity effects should be stronger in countries classified within the Social Democratic welfare state regime type and compensation effects should be stronger in countries within the Conservative welfare state regime type. There is some empirical support for this argument in the data.},

abstract = {One of Max Weber's many theoretical concerns is the fundamental human endeavor to shape a meaningful existence and to anchor it in a socially sanctioned life style. In one formulation Weber presented this drive as the potential means for doing away with the incongruity between human destiny and merit. In this paper the continually renewing search for various meaningful stands, under- taken by the intellectual stratum, is examined as one dimension of the general process of rationalization. The problem of a meaningful cosmos is reviewed in Weber's studies of religion, where it appears in most detail, and as it appears again in some of his studies of modern society, especially its politics and science. Finally, the pessimism Weber displayed in regard to the modern age is related to his doubts concerning the possibility of creating meaningful life styles for the masses of men and women in the fragmented secular culture of our age.},

Yet recent research on the psychology of welfare support suggests that people everywhere form welfare opinions using psychological predispositions designed to regulate interpersonal help giving using cues regarding recipicent effort. We argue that this implies that cross-national differences in welfare support emerge from mutable differences in stereotypes about recipients efforts rather than deep differences in psychological predispositions. Using free-association tasks and experiments embedded in large-scale, nationally representative surveys collected in the United States and Denmark, we test this argument by investigating the stability of opinion differences when faced with the presence and absence of cues about the deservingness of specific welfare recipients. Despite decades of exposure to different cultures and welfare institutions, two sentences of information can make welfare support across the U.S. and Scandinavians samples substantially and statistically indistinguishable.},

Many of their key assumptions, however, are called into question by existing research on "third wave" Latin American democracies. There is little evidence that the poor are more likely to vote for higher taxes or for left parties, and survey research does not indicate that poor people are more likely to think the distribution of income is unfair. More sustained examination of American democracy by Larry M. Bartels reaches parallel conclusions. A more careful examination of political economy assumptions about the relationship between actors' objective economic circumstances and their perceived interests and behavior is needed.

- Se realizar{\'{a}} un an{\'{a}}lisis general de la narrativa se{\~{n}}alada, lo cual busca proponer una altenrativa generada a trav{\'{e}}s del an{\'{a}}lisis narrativo de las explicaciones sociales.

2) Qu{\'{e}} es narratividad?
La original "master narrative" de la modernidad, es una autoconstruida narrativa naturalista, un intento epistemol{\'{o}}gico que busca abstraerse de la hsitoricidad, tiempo y espacio.

2.1. Narrativa y los hsitoriadores

Consistente con desarrollos te{\'{o}}ricos la "marxificacion" y "weberizaci{\'{o}}n" de la historia, la Social history.
Otros enfoque emergieron como un "modo de presentaci{\'{o}}n" del discurso hist{\'{o}}rico. As{\'{i}} tambi{\'{e}}n como las denominadas "non historic"

2.2. Caracter{\'{i}}sticas comunes de la NArrativa Social
i) relacionalidad de las partes
ii) Tramas "causales"
Iiii) apropiaci{\'{o}}n selectiva
iv) temporalidad, secuencia y lugar.

La conectividad entre sus parte es precisamente por qu{\'{e}} los "eventos" se transforman en episodios.

c. Conceptual, analytic, sociologgical narrativity.

abstract = {Subjective social status (SSS), a promising measure of social class or standing, is linked robustly to diverse indicators of mental and physical well-being. However, the processes behind SSS remain poorly understood. Socioeconomic status (SES; e.g., edu- cation, income, or occupation) is among the strongest predictors of SSS, but when and how much does SES matter for understanding differences between given SSS ranks? Drawing on multiple years of national US data (2010–2014 General Social Survey), I show that a quartic form closely describes relationships between SSS and SES: namely, education, income and occupational attainment increase at the bottom of the SSS ladder (between rungs 1–2 and 3) and before the top (between rungs 5–8), increase more modestly (‘‘plateau'') across other ranks, and decrease markedly at the very top (across rungs 9–10). Auxiliary data on wealth accumulation among older Americans (2005 National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States; MIDUS) replicate the quartic form for edu- cation and occupation while also suggesting that high personal net worth (e.g., millionaire status) may help to explain why individuals assign themselves to the very top of the ladder despite holding less education, income or occupational prestige relative to others who rank just below. Additional multinomial analyses showed how probabilities of occupying specific rungs of the SSS ladder shift across levels of SES, confirming that the very top of the ladder is more responsive to gains in personal net worth than to traditional SES measures.},

Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.},

abstract = {To date, Peterson and Kern's (1996) "highbrow omnivorousness" hypothesis has been examined mainly for the case of musical taste. In this paper we attempt to extend this framework to a relatively unexplored cultural domain, that of television consumption. Using data from the 2001 Eurobarometer we hypothesize that highbrows will be more likely to consume a wide variety of other forms of popular culture, namely television programming. The results fail to unambiguously confirm the highbrow omnivorousness hypothesis: in some EU countries, highbrows consume a wider variety of television programming than non-highbrows, in other countries, highbrows are indistinguishable from non-highbrows, while in a third group of countries, highbrows are snobbier than non-highbrows in their television consumption choices. We attempt to explain this cross-national heterogeneity in the highbrow/non-highbrow difference in television consumption using DiMaggio's (1977) organizational theory of culture production. In our "contingent highbrow omnivorousness" framework, we propose that in commercialized, profit-oriented cultural industry systems, highbrow snobbery rather than omnivorousness will be the norm. In relatively less commercialized, profit-oriented contexts, highbrow the snobbery effect will be weaker. Classifying countries by the degree of market orientation of the television production field yields results that are consistent with this hypothesis. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper explores the conditions under which cultural cleavages become politically salient. It does so by taking advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the division of the Chewa and Tumbuka peoples by the border between Zambia and Malawi. I document that, while the objective cultural differences between Chewas and Tumbukas on both sides of the border are identical, the political salience of the division between these communities is altogether different. I argue that this difference stems from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka communities in each country relative to each country's national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas are each large groups vis-{\`{a}}-vis the country as a whole and, thus, serve as viable bases for political coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not useful to mobilize as bases of political support. The analysis suggests that the political salience of a cultural cleavage depends not on the nature of the cleavage itself (since it is identical in both countries) but on the sizes of the groups it defines and whether or not they will be useful vehicles for political competition.},

We review the burgeoning literature on (mis)perceptions of inequality. First, we show that people on average misperceive current levels of inequality, typically underestimating the extent of inequality in their country. Second, we delineate potential causes of these misperceptions, including people's overreliance on cues from their local environment, leading to their erroneous beliefs about both the overall distributions of wealth and income and their place in those distributions. Third, we document that these (mis)perceptions of inequality — but not actual levels of inequality — drive behavior and preferences for redistribution. More promisingly, we review research suggesting that correcting misperceptions influences preferences and policy outcomes.},

annote = {Las protestas de Stonewall han sido reconocidas como un punto o evento importante para la comunidad gay americana.

- gay liberation movement event

Stonewall Riot: un antes y un despu{\'{e}}s

Para entonces, en los 60's, las redadas a los bares gays, eran cosa com{\'{u}}n.

Pregunta: ¿POr qu{\'{e}} los eventos en Stonewall tomaron tal importancia, mientras que otros similares no?

1. Memoria colectiva como "im{\'{a}}genes del pasado" que los grupos sociales seleccionan, reproducen, y conmemoran a trav{\'{e}}s de una serie de pr{\'{a}}cticas.
2. La pregunta de este aspeco ha ido m{\'{a}}s en el c{\'{o}}mo, versus el por qu{\'{e}}, de que ciertos grupos recuerden ciertos eventos. 
3. "mnemonic capacity": La memoria colectiva opera en dimensiones tiempo/espacio. El hecho de que en NY ya exist{\'{i}}a un movimiento gay, encontr{\'{o}} la resonancia para que un evento como Stonewall tuviese mayor importancia.
- "Commmemorative vehicles" survive, grew an spread. Se institucionaliz{\'{o}} a trav{\'{e}}s de eventos anuales.

Formaci{\'{o}}n de eventos:
Para una determinada comunidad, la importancia medi{\'{a}}tica o disrruptiva del evento, hace que tome parte de su memoria.

Capaciadad "Mnemonic"

La conmemorabilidad de un evento en lenguaje de movimiento sociales: " Framing" para que la gente apruebe, financie y participe de la conmemoraci{\'{o}}n.

- Capacidad de construir veh{\'{i}}culos conmemorativos o veh{\'{i}}culos de memoria.
- La capacidad de crear dichos veh{\'{i}}culos, en habilidades y recursos necesarios, se le llama la mnemonic capacity. Viene del hecho de "crear memoria" o "construir memoria"

- La capacidad organizativa no es lo mismo que la nemot{\'{e}}cnica. Pueden tener capacidad de organizar, peron no de generar impacto comunicacional.

Resonancia

Un veh{\'{i}}culo permite determinar un plan de c{\'{o}}mo, d{\'{o}}nde y por qui{\'{e}}nes, un evento ser{\'{a}} conmemorado. "Resuena" 

El cultrual power que determinados objetos u eventos tienen, permitebn enjendrar una forma dde interpretar los eventos. 

Actores con capacida nemot{\'{e}}tica estan mejor posiconados para generar veh{\'{i}}culos conmemorativos institucionalmente resonantes
Por el contrario, actores con uba baja capacidad nemot{\'{e}}tica, dependen m{\'{a}}s de la participaci{\'{o}}n voluntaria, dado que no tienen la capacidad de crear un vech{\'{i}}culo altamente resonante. Heavy movimiento estudiantil.

Objetivo
identificar las condiciones generales que contribuyeron a la conmemoraci{\'{o}}n y desarrollo de una explicaci{\'{o}}n espec{\'{i}}fica del por qu{\'{e}} estuvieron m{\'{a}}s presentes en el caso de Stonewall.

- Se comparan eventos en funci{\'{o}}n de (1) capacidad nemot{\'{e}}tica y (2) Conmemorabilidad

Nota epist{\'{e}}mica! se trabaja inductivamente como deductivamente. Se transita entre ambos puntos!.
- Se emplea la narrativa como una forma de desarrollar "inferencia causal"
- En general, detalla c{\'{o}}mo los eventos de riots anteriores sirvieron como antecedentes para la creaci{\'{o}}n de una coyuntura especial, la cual a su vez, brind{\'{o}} las bases para el evento.

Caracter{\'{i}}sticas
1.Conflictos con la polic{\'{i}}a.
2. Caracter{\'{i}}sticas del bar, n de gente

1. Alta conmemorabilidad y baja nemotecnica: San Francisco.

"La gente a menudo justifica el lugar {\'{u}}nico de Stonewall en la memoria colectiva gay declarando que fue el primer disturbio homosexual. No era."

2. Baja conmemorabilidad y capacidad nemot{\'{e}}cnica de menos a m{\'{a}}s: Los {\'{A}}ngeles.

SF muy liberal y LA con represi{\'{o}}n brutal. NY se radicalizaba como respuesta a un ambiente pol{\'{i}}tico inconsistente.

- Protesta p{\'{u}}blica como estrategia

Discusi{\'{o}}n:
la resiliencia de Stonewall es relevante, por sus persistencia en los registros hit{\'{o}}ricos. La capacidad de generar resonancia o por su "carisma".

1. La pre-existencia de un movimiento gay es fundamental.
2. La importancia "causal" de este contexto es crucial para medir el alcance del evento.
3. Sin la radicalidad pol{\'{i}}tica de los activistas, marcado por los niveles de organizaci{\'{o}}n, la resonancia del evento no habr{\'{i}}a llegado al punto de transencer, es decir, por su capacidad mnemot{\'{e}}cnica.

** La importancia de haber tenido hombres gays, con mayores ingresos, educadots y pol{\'{i}}ticamente gormados: peri{\'{o}}dicos y sorteos legales. Mayores recursos = mayor efectividad pol{\'{i}}tica, y por tanto, resonancia p{\'{u}}blica.

- Muy interesante considerar el factor "clase" y "raza" because they where white-gay-man, not just gay man.

The first section develops a framework for justice analysis, distinguishing between ingredients thought to be universal and ingredients in which culture may operate. The second section discusses deductive theories in justice analysis and provides an illustration, in which one of the theories yields implications for individualism and collectivism, thus showing how justice processes can generate phenomena that come to be viewed as culturally based.The concluding section briefly discusses agendas and research designs for empirical analysis of justice and culture.},

abstract = {Education is thought to be the pathway to success for disadvantaged groups. Given that young women now match or surpass men's educational achievements on many measures, how do they fare in terms of equal earnings? Would further educational changes matter for closing any existing gap? Analyzing data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey, the author found that college-educated men in their mid-20s already earn, on average, about {\$}7,000 more per year than do college-educated women. The findings suggest that this gap would still be substantial–about {\$}4,400 per year–if women and men had similar educational credentials, scores on standardized tests, fields of study, and degrees from colleges of similar selectivity. Although women's gains in education may have been central to narrowing the gender gap in income historically, gender differences in fields of study continue to disadvantage women. Moreover, gender differences in work-related factors are more important than are educational differences for understanding contemporary income inequality among young workers.},

abstract = {A major finding in comparative mobility research is the high similarity across countries and the lack of association between mobility and other national attributes, with one exception: higher inequality seems to be associated with lower mobility. Evidence for the mobility–inequality link is, however, inconclusive, largely because most mobility studies have been conducted in advanced countries with relatively similar levels of inequality.This article introduces Chile to the comparative project. As the 10th most unequal country in the world, Chile is an adjudicative case. If high inequality results in lower mobility, Chile should be significantly more rigid than its industrialized peers. This hypothesis is disproved by the analysis. Despite vast economic inequality, Chile is as fluid, if not more so, than the much more equal industrialized nations. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a decline in mobility as the result of the increase in inequality during the market-oriented transformation of the country in the 1970s and 1980s. Study of the specific mobility flows in Chile indicates a significant barrier to long-range downward mobility from the elite (signaling high “elite closure”), but very low barriers across nonelite classes. This particular mobility regime is explained by the pattern, not the level, of Chilean inequality—high concentration in the top income decile, but significantly less inequality across the rest of the class structure. The high Chilean mobility is, however, largely inconsequential, because it takes place among classes that share similar positions in the social hierarchy of resources and rewards. The article concludes by redefining the link between inequality and mobility.},

Over the past 15 years, these connections have resulted in the elaboration and application of the cumulative advantage-disadvantage perspective in social gerontology, especially in relation to issues of heterogeneity and inequality. However, its theoretical origins, connections, and implications are not widely understood. This article reviews the genesis of the cumulative advantage/disadvantage perspective in studies of science, its initial articulation with structural-functionalism, and its expanding importance for gerontology. It discusses its intellectual relevance for several other established theoretical paradigms in sociology, psychology, and economics. On the basis of issues deriving from these perspectives and from the accumulating body of work on cumulative advantage and disadvantage, I identify several promising directions for further research in gerontology.},

Do CEE citizens believe that inequality is excessive and, if so, why? And what is the connection between perceptions of social inequality and citizens' views of new markets and democracy? These questions are addressed using new data from mass surveys conducted in 2007 in 12 post-communist CEE states. Surprisingly weak links are found between social inequality perceptions and national-level measures of inequality as well economic, social and political conditions. Perceptions of social inequality are mainly driven by individual-level assessments of market and democratic performance, but not by market or democratic ideals.},

abstract = {This review provides a critical appraisal of the measurement of students' social class and socioeconomic status (SES) in the context of widening higher education participation. Most assessments of social class and SES in higher education have focused on objective measurements based on the income, occupation, and education of students' parents, and they have tended to overlook diversity among students based on factors such as age, ethnicity, indigeneity, and rurality. However, recent research in psychology and sociology has stressed the more subjective and intersectional nature of social class. The authors argue that it is important to consider subjective self-definitions of social class and SES alongside more traditional objective measures. The implications of this dual measurement approach for higher education research are discussed.},

abstract = {We design an experiment to study the effects of social identity on preferences over redistribution. The experiment highlights the trade-off between social identity concerns and maximization of monetary payoffs. Subjects belonging to two distinct natural groups are randomly assigned gross incomes and vote over alternative redistributive tax regimes, where the regime is chosen by majority rule. We find that a significant subset of the subjects systematically deviate from monetary payoff maximization towards the tax rate that benefits their group when the monetary cost of doing so is not too high. These deviations cannot be explained by efficiency concerns, inequality aversion, reciprocity, social learning or conformity. Finally, we show that behavior in the lab helps explain the relationship between reported income and stated preferences over redistribution observed in survey data. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In 1985, the General Social Survey (GSS) collected the first nationally representative data on the confidants with whom Americans discuss important matters. In the 2004 GSS the authors replicated those questions to assess social change in core network structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985. The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents, with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods.

abstract = {People's motivation to rationalize and defend the status quo is a major barrier to societal change. Three studies tested whether perceived social mobility—beliefs about the likelihood to move up and down the socioeconomic ladder—can condition people's tendency to engage in system justification. Compared to information suggesting moderate social mobility, exposure to low social mobility frames consistently reduced defense of the overarching societal system. Two studies examined how this effect occurs. Compared to moderate or baseline conditions, a low social mobility frame reduced people's endorsement of (typically strong) meritocratic and just-world beliefs, which in turn explained lower system defense. These effects occurred for political liberals, moderates, and conservatives and could not be explained by other system-legitimizing ideologies or people's beliefs about their own social mobility. Implications for societal change programs are discussed.},

abstract = {Individual perceptions of income distribution play a vital role in political economy and public finance models, yet there is little evidence regarding their origins or accuracy. This study examines how individuals form these perceptions and posits that systematic biases arise from the extrapolation of information extracted from reference groups. A tailored household survey provides original evidence on the significant biases in individuals' evaluations of their own relative position in the distribution. Furthermore, the data supports the hypothesis that the selection process into the reference groups is the source of those biases. Finally, this study also assesses the practical relevance of these biases by examining their impact on attitudes towards redistributive policies. An experimental design incorporated into the survey provides consistent information on the own ranking within the income distribution to a randomly selected group of respondents. Confronting agents' biased perceptions with this information has a significant effect on their stated preferences for redistribution. Those who had overestimated their relative position and thought of themselves relatively richer than they were demand higher levels of redistribution when informed of their true ranking. This relationship between biased perceptions and political attitudes provides an alternative explanation for the relatively low degree of redistribution observed in modern democracies.},

Fairness preferences are relevant for redistribution outcomes only if fair-minded voters are pivotal. Pivotality, in turn, depends on the structure of income classes. We experimentally study voting on redistribution between two income classes and show that the effect of inequality aversion is asymmetric.

abstract = {In Colombia, diabetes mellitus is a public health program for those responsible for creating and implementing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up that are applicable at all care levels, with the objective of establishing early and sustained control of diabetes. A clinical practice guide has been developed following the broad outline of the methodological guide from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, with the aim of systematically gathering scientific evidence and formulating recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. The current document presents in summary form the results of this process, including the recommendations and the considerations taken into account in formulating them. In general terms, what is proposed here is a screening process using the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score questionnaire adapted to the Colombian population, which enables early diagnosis of the illness, and an algorithm for determining initial treatment that can be generalized to most patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and that is simple to apply in a primary care context. In addition, several recommendations have been made to scale up pharmacological treatment in those patients that do not achieve the objectives or fail to maintain them during initial treatment. These recommendations also take into account the evolution of weight and the individualization of glycemic control goals for special populations. Finally, recommendations have been made for opportune detection of micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes. En Colombia la Diabetes Mellitus es un problema de salud p{\'{u}}blica por lo que deben generarse e implementarse estrategias de prevenci{\'{o}}n, diagn{\'{o}}stico, tratamiento y seguimiento, aplicables en todos los niveles de atenci{\'{o}}n con miras a establecer el control de la diabetes en forma temprana y sostenida.

abstract = {How do national institutional contexts mediate the global? This article aims to answer this question by analyzing screen translation—the translation of audiovisual materials like movies and television programs—in four European countries: France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland. A cross-national, multi-method research project combining interviews, ethnography, and a small survey found considerable cross-national differences in translation norms and practices, sometimes leading to very different translated versions of the same product. The analysis shows how differences between national translation fields are produced and perpetuated by the interplay of institutional factors on four interdependent levels: technology, and the organizational, national, and transnational fields. On each level, various institutions are influential in shaping nationally specific translation norms and practices by producing institutional constraints or imposing specific meanings. I propose a model that explains the persistence of national translation systems—not only from the logics of specific institutions, fields, or levels—but by the feedback loops and interdependencies between institutions on various levels. This analysis has implications for the sociological understanding of globalization, the production of culture and media, cross-national comparative research, as well as institutional theory and the role of translation in sociological practice.

We identify the generations by a set of core studies and categorize them with respect to data collection, measurement, analytical models, research problems, main hypotheses, and substantive results. We go on to discuss a number of new topics and approaches that have gained prominence in the research agenda in the last decade. We conclude that the field has progressed considerably with respect to data collection and measurement; that shifts across generations with respect to data analytic and modelling strategies do not unambiguously represent advances; and that with respect to problem development and theory formulation the field has become excessively narrow.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In this article we argue that the legitimacy and stability of the social and political order in Britain is undermined by persistent inequalities of skills and opportunities. We first contend that British society is characterised by a liberal regime of social cohesion. Crucial to such a regime is the belief in individual opportunity and rewards based on merit. We demonstrate, through comparative analysis, that skills inequality is actually higher and social mobility lower in Britain than in other western countries. Also the perception of equal opportunities is lower. In Britain there is thus a mismatch between the cherished ideal of meritocracy and the reality of a stratified society, both objectively and perceived. This, we postulate, is likely to contribute to the political alienation of disadvantaged groups. We argue that in theory adult learning could reduce the skills gap but that in reality it only magnifies skills inequality since in Britain the well educated and people in work have higher participation rates than the poorly educated and unemployed.},

This article challenges the current conception and measurement of “diversity” and invites scholars to rethink “social capital” in complex societies. It reproduces the analysis of Putnam and shows that the association between diversity and self-reported trust is a compositional artifact attributable to residential sorting: nonwhites report lower trust and are overrepresented in heterogeneous communities. The association between diversity and trust is better explained by differences between communities and their residents in terms of race/ethnicity, residential stability, and economic conditions; these classic indicators of inequality, not diversity, strongly and consistently predict self-reported trust. Diversity indexes also obscure the distinction between in-group and out-group contact. For whites, heterogeneity means more out-group neighbors; for nonwhites, heterogeneity means more in-group neighbors. Theref...},

Regression with covariate adjustment is often used to account for these features. It is known however that in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects this approach does not yield unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. But it is not well known how estimates generated in this way diverge from unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. Here we show that biases can be large, even in large samples. However we also find conditions under which the usual approach provides interpretable estimates and we identify a monotonicity condition that ensures that least squares estimates lie between estimates of the average treatment effects for the treated and the average treatment effects for the controls. The monotonicity condition can be satisfied for example with Roy-type selection and is guaranteed in the two stratum case.},

To establish the validity of test score comparisons over time, longitudinal measurement invariance should be established. The current study tested whether the 19 item Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) is measurement invariant (MI) over time. As the first five items of the scale are often used to screen for the presence of suicidal thoughts, we also tested a model consisting of only the first five items. Psychiatric in- and out-patients (n=475) completed the questionnaire upon admission and after 3 months. By means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) we tested whether the parameters of a single factor model were equal over time. All fit indices indicated that both the 19-item questionnaire and the five-item screener were measurement invariant over time. This means that changes in test-scores over time can be attributed to true changes in the construct of interest. These findings legitimate the use of the 19 item scale and the five-item screener in longitudinal assessments.},

abstract = {This contribution provides a long-term assessment of intergenerational social mobility trends in the United States across the 20th and early 21st centuries and assesses the determinants of those trends. In particular, we study how educational expansion has contributed to the observed changes in mobility opportunities for men across cohorts. Drawing on recently developed decomposition methods, we empirically identify the contribution of each of the multiple channels through which changing rates of educational participation shape mobility trends. We find that a modest but gradual increase in social class mobility can nearly exclusively be ascribed to an interaction known as the compositional effect, according to which the direct influence of social class backgrounds on social class destinations is lower among the growing number of individuals attaining higher levels of education. This dominant role of the compositional effect is also due to the fact that, despite pronounced changes in the distribution of education, class inequality in education has remained stable while class returns to education have shown no consistent trend. Our analyses also provide a cautionary tale about mistaking increasing levels of social class mobility for a general trend toward more fluidity in the United States. The impact of parental education on son's educational and class attainment has grown or remained stable, respectively. Here, the compositional effect pertaining to the direct association between parental education and son's class attainment counteracts a long-term trend of increasing inequality in educational attainment tied to parents' education.},

There are substantial differences in the achievement of private and public schools, usually around one-half a standard deviation. A small portion of these differences is accounted for by the higher socioeconomic status of students in private schools. A quite substantial portion is explained by the varying peer group characteristics in private and public schools. After accounting for peer characteristics, the average private school effect across all 10 countries is zero, though with some variance around this mean (the effects range between -0.2 and 0.2 standard deviations). Evidence on selection bias is inconclusive, but the paper argues that these effects may constitute an upper bound to the true effects.},

abstract = {This article presents a theorem connecting the goodness or badness of a thing with the goodness or badness of inequality in the thing's distribution. The theorem, which applies to cardinally measurable things like income, debt, years in prison, disease risk, and risk of unemployment, states that if an observer regards the original thing as a good (bad), then that observer regards inequality in the thing's distribution as a bad (good). The proof uses three inequality measures and two fairness measures embedding observer framing of things as good or bad. The theorem touches many themes in the sociological literature, not only goods and bads, inequality and stratification, the Weberian life chances, values, and attitudes toward inequality, but also, via its proof, fairness and moral development. Further, the theorem and its proof raise questions that provide new directions for theoretical and empirical research. For example, empirical tasks ahead include (1) learning more about inequality in bads (especially about their frequency distributions and inequality measures, to match the growing knowledge about differences across subgroups), and (2) studying both just rewards and justice evaluations, in both goods and bads, to assess the scope of justice concerns between earned and unearned things and between additive, transferable possessions and nonadditive, nontransferable characteristics. Finally, this work contributes to the growing understanding of the connections between inequality, justice, and the vast behavioural and social outcomes which inequality and justice, separately or together, generate.},

The underlying intuition is that these individuals rationally expect to be richer than average in the future. This result holds provided the mobility process is concave in expectations, redistribution policies are expected to last for a sufficiently long period and individuals are not too risk averse. This paper tests the POUM hypothesis by means of a within subjects experiment where the concavity of the mobility process, the degree of social mobility, the knowledge of personal income and the degree of inequality are used as treatments. Other determinants of the demand for redistribution, such as risk aversion and inequality aversion are (partially) controlled for via either the experiment design or the information collected during the experiment. We find that the POUM hypothesis holds under alternative specifications, even when we control for individual fixed effects.},

Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

@article{Bianchi2012,
abstract = {“Is Anyone Doing the Housework?” (Bianchi et al. 2000) was motivated, like much of the research on housework, by a desire to better understand gender inequality and social change in the work and family arena in the United States. During the 1990s, Arlie Hochschild's (1989) influential book, The Second Shift, provided the dominant assessment of the gender division of labor in the home (Konigsberg 2011): men were unwilling to share the burden of work in the home and thus employed women came home to a “second shift” of housework and childcare, increasing gender inequality. Her rich qualitative study was based on a small sample of unknown generalizability, however (Milkie, Raley, {\&} Bianchi 2009). The collection and release of the large and nationally representative 1987- 88 National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) unleashed a flurry of housework articles in the quantitative sociological literature. The NSFH had the advantage of reports of housework from both members of a couple and husbands' and wives' assessments of fairness in the household division of labor, but these data could not provide the trend analysis critical to the understanding of social change that time diary data collections allowed. “Is Anyone Doing the Housework?” used the NSFH but also presented analysis of the only nationally representative data available – time diaries – with which to assess trends in housework and broaden the discussion of how women and men might be reallocating time in the home during a period of rapid change in women's work outside the home. The citation count in Google Scholar stands at 910 citations (as of April 20, 2012), with those citations continuing to the present.1 In the article, we showed that the gender division of labor in housework became more equal over this period, in part because men increased their time in housework but more importantly because women dramatically decreased the time they spent in these activities. Men increased their propensity to do housework and the increase was not a result of change in population composition, whereas for women it was a mix of decreased likelihood of doing housework but also an increase in the proportion of women least likely to spend time in housework (e.g., employed women). We compared time diary data to the NSFH, demonstrating that the NSFH survey questions resulted in estimates that were about 50 percent higher than time diary estimates but that both data sources yielded similar conclusions about the gender gap in housework. Finally, using the NSFH data, we provided a multivariate description of the correlates of wives' housework time, husbands' housework time and the gender gap in housework time of married couples. The findings remain relevant today, save the need for the update of trends provided here. Using time diary data for 1965, 1975, 1985 and 1995, our observation window on housework was one in which the pressure on women to “shed load” to accommodate increased market work was high and in which the pressure on men to “pick up some of the slack” was perhaps also high. Our data analysis spanned the 1970-90 period of greatest labor force increases for U.S. women, particularly married women with young children. Subsequent trend analyses of women's labor force participation, housework and childcare in the 1990s showed much less increase and a leveling off in rates by the end of the 20th century (Sayer 2005; Sayer, Bianchi, {\&} Robinson 2004), causing some to argue that the gender revolution was over (Cotter, Hermsen, {\&} Vanneman 2011).},

We assess whether and why the class-specific impact of self-transcendence and self-enhancement values on attitudes towards redistribution differs across a selection of European countries. The results show that the links between values and attitudes are generally stronger in more materially secure and privileged classes. However, the relative strength of the associations varies substantially across countries. Where inequality is smaller and poverty less prevalent, the link between values and attitudes becomes less class-specific. These findings provide support for our two main interpretations: (a) that welfare policies mitigate the class-specific risks that people are exposed to, which make values more salient and effective among workers; and (b) that the existence of visible and salient redistributive policies works to make clearer the cognitive link between abstract values and support for concrete policies.},

To conceptualize gender as a structure situates gender at the same level of general social significance as the economy and the polity. The author also argues that while concern with intersectionality must continue to be paramount, different structures of inequality have different constructions and perhaps different influential causal mechanisms at any given historical moment. We need to follow a both/and strategy to understand gender structure, race structure, and other structures of inequality as they currently operate while also systematically paying attention to how these axes of domination intersect. Finally, the author suggests we pay more attention to doing research and writing theory with explicit attention to how our work can indeed help transform as well as inform society.},

For this reason, a great deal of political activity entails attempts to change other people's preferences. When do politically relevant preferences change? Addressing this question requires recognition of two realities: (a) Many stimuli compete for every person's attention, and (b) every person's capacity to pay attention to information is limited. With these realities in mind, we review research on preference change in competitive environments. We discuss how individuals allocate attention and how individuals' values and identities affect their use of the information to which they attend. We then discuss how this work has been applied to a new problem: improving the communication of scientific facts in increasingly politicized environments.},

abstract = {There is extensive research on the causes and consequences of actual social mobility but much less is known about subjective social mobility – about how people believe their adult social position compares to their parents' position. The ISSP Inequality-III surveys of 1999/2000 asked respondents to compare the status of their most recent job with the status of their father's job when the respondent was a teenager (N= 31 691 in 30 nations). On average, people thought they had moved up a moderate amount compared to their fathers, although women thought they had moved up less than men did. The actual gain in occupational status between father and offspring is an important influence on this subjective mobility (beta = .27) but it is not the only influence. Two other changes also influenced subjective mobility: educational gains between parent and offspring, and country-wide gains in GDP between when the respondent was growing up and the present. Income and authority also matter. Subjective social mobility has important consequences, even controlling for actual social mobility, education, income, gender, and authority. Those who think themselves mobile identify with a higher class subjectively, are more likely to think their pay is just, and believe they ought to earn high salaries. Thus understanding subjective social mobility helps us to understand other aspects of society, especially attitudes towards inequality.},

In general, I find that Americans generally endorse the idea that hard work leads to success and that economic mobility is possible for those willing to put in the effort, but that there is significant individual and contextual variation in support for those beliefs. I find that most variation in support for meritocratic belief is a function of simple partisan politics: differences between liberals and conservatives, and between Democrats and Republicans, are far more important to explaining meritocratic belief than any other sociodemographic factor. But attributes of the context in which one lives matter as well. Among other things, this paper highlights the importance of local economic decline as an important topic for future research: those who live in communities that have seen their relative economic fortunes drop over the past decade are less likely to believe in meritocracy than those who have seen their communities thrive.},

This article fills this void by investigating within-couple earnings inequality in the event of a childbirth in different institutional settings. Two re- search questions are addressed: (i) Does a childbirth lead to a reduction in women's earned income relative to their partner? (ii) Can mothers compensate the loss of labour-related income through alter- native sources of income? Fixed effects panel models on EU-SILC (2004–2008) data from eight European countries show that having a child negatively affects women's share of earned income in the majority of countries. However, cross-national differences in the results suggest that in countries where income support for parents is higher, mothers can rely on non-labour sources of income, such as payments from parental leave benefits, to compensate the reduction of relative earned income. In other words, the results indicate a relative motherhood penalty in earnings that is not, ultimately, a relative motherhood penalty in income, at least in the short run. In countries where income support for parents is lower, by contrast, the negative effect of a childbirth on the mothers' earnings is small- est, indicating that women privilege remaining in the work force around childbirth.},
